Until now, scientists have found indirect and conflicting signs of wave activity, based on Cassini images of Titan's surface.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2024 19:37:31 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Democratizing data: Discovering data use and value for research and policy</title><link>https://new.nsf.gov/news/democratizing-data-discovering-data-use-value</link><description>Data access and discovery continue to be topics of great interest across the federal data ecosystem.

For households with exposure from multiple sources, the EPA lowered the guidance to 100 ppm; nearly 40% of households exceed that level, the study also found.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2024 19:37:19 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Collaborative approaches improve materials informatics workforce training</title><link>https://new.nsf.gov/news/collaborative-approaches-improve-materials</link><description>A wide range of innovative products, from biomedical implants to aerospace composites, come from research in materials informatics (MI) — the combination of machine learning, artificial intelligence and computational methodologies with materials…</description><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2024 17:00:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Jupiter's great red spot is not the same one Cassini observed in 1600s</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/06/240619143717.htm</link><image_url>https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-logo-rss.png</image_url><description>Jupiter's iconic Great Red Spot has persisted for at least 190 years and is likely a different spot from the one observed by the astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini in 1665, a new study reports. The Great Red Spot we see today likely formed because of an instability in the planet's intense atmospheric winds, producing a long, persistent atmospheric cell, the study also finds.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2024 19:37:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Shipworms still hold some sea-crets</title><link>https://new.nsf.gov/news/shipworms-still-hold-some-sea-crets</link><description>Although they have been known to mariners for centuries — having aided in shipwrecking Columbus and sinking parts of the Spanish Armada — scientists have not been able to determine how shipworms digest wood, until now.

Even seemingly sedentary non-native plants are moving at three times the speed of their native counterparts in a race where, because of the rapid pace of climate change and its effect on habitat, speed matters. To survive, plants and animals need to be shifting their ranges by 3.25 kilometers per year just to keep up with the increasing temperatures and associated climactic shifts -- a speed that native species cannot manage without human help.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2024 19:36:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>This week with NSF Director Panchanathan</title><link>https://new.nsf.gov/news/week-nsf-director-panchanathan-56</link><description>This week, NSF Director Sethuraman Panchanathan highlighted NSF’s commitment to innovation and STEM advancements through several key events.

Coupled with the fact that glassy gels are simple to produce, the material holds promise for a variety of applications.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2024 19:35:56 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
