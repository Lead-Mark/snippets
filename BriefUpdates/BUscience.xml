The newly-discovered bacterial symbiont is closely related to the nitrogen-fixing Rhizobia which live in partnership with many crop plants and may open up new avenues to engineer nitrogen-fixing plants.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 17:47:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Big data helps determine what drives disease risk</title><link>https://new.nsf.gov/news/big-data-helps-determine-what-drives-disease-risk</link><description>Working with nearly 3,000 observations across almost 1,500 host-parasite combinations, U.S. National Science Foundation-supported researchers at Notre Dame University have found that biodiversity loss, chemical pollution, introduced species and…</description><pubDate>Wed, 08 May 2024 16:14:10 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Liberals and conservatives differ on climate change beliefs--but are relatively united in taking action</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/05/240509110900.htm</link><description>The division between liberals and conservatives on both climate-change beliefs and related policy support is long-standing. However, the results of a newly released global experiment show that despite these differences, the two camps actually align when it comes to taking certain actions to combat climate change.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 16:09:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Discovery in tomato could lead to natural pesticides</title><link>https://new.nsf.gov/news/discovery-tomato-could-lead-natural-pesticides</link><description>Like a slightly revised version of the movie "The Parent Trap," U.S. National Science Foundation-supported researchers from Michigan State University have discovered that tomato plants have two related but separate pathways for producing acylsugars…</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2024 20:40:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>2D all-organic perovskites: potential use in 2D electronics</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/05/240509110857.htm</link><description>Perovskites are among the most researched topics in materials science. Recently, a research team has solved an age-old challenge to synthesize all-organic two-dimensional perovskites, extending the field into the exciting realm of 2D materials. This breakthrough opens up a new field of 2D all-organic perovskites, which holds promise for both fundamental science and potential applications.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 16:08:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>NSF-led National AI Research Resource Pilot awards first round access to 35 projects in partnership with DOE</title><link>https://new.nsf.gov/news/nsf-led-national-ai-research-resource-pilot-awards</link><description>The U.S. National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy are thrilled to announce the first 35 projects that will be supported with computational time through the National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR) Pilot, marking a…</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2024 16:00:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Generative AI that imitates human motion</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/05/240509110822.htm</link><description>Walking and running is notoriously difficult to recreate in robots. Now, a group of researchers has overcome some of these challenges by creating an innovative method that employs central pattern generators -- neural circuits located in the spinal cord that generate rhythmic patterns of muscle activity -- with deep reinforcement learning. The method not only imitates walking and running motions but also generates movements for frequencies where motion data is absent, enables smooth transition movements from walking to running, and allows for adapting to environments with unstable surfaces.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 16:08:22 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>This week with NSF Director Panchanathan</title><link>https://new.nsf.gov/news/week-nsf-director-panchanathan-50</link><description>This week, Sethuraman Panchanathan, director of the U.S. National Science Foundation, has been actively forwarding science, education and engineering initiatives through meaningful collaborations with congressional leaders and NSF researchers.

These potential discoveries about Pop III stars hold the promise of unlocking the secrets of the universe's origin and providing a deeper understanding of the remarkable journey from the primordial cosmos to the world we inhabit today.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 16:07:53 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
