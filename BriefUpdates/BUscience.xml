This breakthrough finding revealed a long-postulated hidden spatial grammar embedded in DNA. The research could reshape scientists' understanding of gene regulation and how genetic variations may influence gene expression in development or disease.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2024 17:44:48 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Astronomers record new precision data to help unlock the mysteries of magnetar birth</title><link>https://new.nsf.gov/news/astronomers-record-new-precision-data-help-unlock-mysteries</link><image_url>https://lead-mark.github.io/snippets/genNewsImagesTwo/Picture1.png</image_url><description>A team of international astronomers using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), part of the U.S. National Science Foundation National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), have gathered the most precise and detailed position and velocity measurements…</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 13:00:07 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Using AI to find the polymers of the future</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/08/240819185140.htm</link><image_url>https://lead-mark.github.io/snippets/genNewsImagesTwo/Picture2.png</image_url><description>Finding the next groundbreaking polymer is always a challenge, but now researchers are using artificial intelligence (AI) to shape and transform the future of the field.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 23:51:40 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
