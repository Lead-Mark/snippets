These results are important for understanding not only how Mars formed and evolved, but also for providing precise data that can inform recent NASA missions like Insight and Perseverance and the Mars Sample Return.</description><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2024 23:28:52 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Glimpses of a volcanic world: New telescope images of Jupiter's moon Io rival those from spacecraft</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/05/240530182217.htm</link><image_url>https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-logo-rss.png</image_url><description>Combining a new imaging instrument with the powerful adaptive optics capabilities of the Large Binocular Telescope, astronomers have captured a volcanic event on Jupiter's moon Io at a resolution never before achieved with Earth-based observations.</description><pubDate>Thu, 30 May 2024 23:22:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>'Ugly' fossil places extinct saber-toothed cat on Texas coast</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/05/240530182207.htm</link><image_url>https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-logo-rss.png</image_url><description>This fossil looks like a lumpy, rounded rock with a couple of exposed teeth that are a little worse for wear, having been submerged and tumbled along the floor of the Gulf of Mexico for thousands of years before washing up on a beach. But when it was X-rayed a doctoral student saw there was more to the fossil that met the eye: a hidden canine tooth that had not yet erupted from the jaw bone. It was just what researchers needed to identify the fossil as belonging to a Homotherium, a genus of large cat that roamed much of the Earth for millions of years.</description><pubDate>Thu, 30 May 2024 23:22:07 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>In the brain at rest, neurons rehearse future experience</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/05/240530182203.htm</link><image_url>https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-logo-rss.png</image_url><description>New research sheds light on how individual neurons in the hippocampus of rats stabilize and tune spatial representations during periods of rest following the animals' first time running a maze, offering first proof of neuroplasticity during sleep.</description><pubDate>Thu, 30 May 2024 23:22:03 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
