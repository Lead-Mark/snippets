Scientists have now deciphered the structure of the avian influenza virus's polymerase when it interacts with a human protein essential for the virus to replicate within the cell. The structure of this replication complex provides important information about the mutations that avian influenza polymerase must undergo to adapt to mammals, including humans. These results can help scientists monitor the evolution and adaptability of bird flu strains, such as H5N1 or H7N9, towards infecting other species.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 18:07:40 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>When things get dusty, expect rainfall changes</title><link>https://new.nsf.gov/news/when-things-get-dusty-expect-rainfall-changes</link><image_url>https://lead-mark.github.io/snippets/genNewsImagesTwo/Picture4.png</image_url><description>Researchers with support from the U.S. National Science Foundation recently discovered that Saharan dust is the number one variable linked to tropical cyclone rainfall.

Researchers look at buildings and other urban structures as physicists consider elements in complex material systems. With this insight, the researchers have developed a new approach to urban flood modelling and found their results helpful in analyzing city-to-city variations in flood risk globally.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 18:07:35 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Astronomers record new precision data to help unlock the mysteries of magnetar birth</title><link>https://new.nsf.gov/news/astronomers-record-new-precision-data-help-unlock-mysteries</link><image_url>https://lead-mark.github.io/snippets/genNewsImagesTwo/Picture4.png</image_url><description>A team of international astronomers using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), part of the U.S. National Science Foundation National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), have gathered the most precise and detailed position and velocity measurements…</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 13:00:07 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Searching old stem cells that stay young forever</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/08/240819130732.htm</link><image_url>https://lead-mark.github.io/snippets/genNewsImagesTwo/Picture5.png</image_url><description>The sea anemone Nematostella vectensis is potentially immortal. Using molecular genetic methods, developmental biologists have now identified possible candidates for multipotent stem cells in the sea anemone for the first time. These stem cells are regulated by evolutionary highly conserved genes.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 18:07:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Process by which COVID-19 latches onto and enters human cells is revealed</title><link>https://new.nsf.gov/news/process-which-covid-19-latches-enters-human-cells</link><image_url>https://lead-mark.github.io/snippets/genNewsImagesTwo/Picture2.png</image_url><description>A team led by researchers with the U.S. National Science Foundation Physics Frontiers Center for Theoretical Biological Physics at Rice University have provided a new atomic-level understanding of how coronaviruses, including the virus that causes…</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Aug 2024 19:16:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Spider exploits firefly's flashing signals to lure more prey</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/08/240819130522.htm</link><image_url>https://lead-mark.github.io/snippets/genNewsImagesTwo/Picture2.png</image_url><description>Fireflies rely on flashing signals to communicate to other fireflies using light-emitting lanterns on their abdomens. In fireflies of the species Abscondita terminalis, males make multi-pulse flashes with two lanterns to attract females, while females make single-pulse flashes with their one lantern to attract males. Now researchers have evidence that an orb-weaving spider (Araneus ventricosus) manipulates the flashing signals of male fireflies ensnared in its web such that they mimic the typical flashes of a female firefly, thereby luring other males to serve as their next meal.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 18:05:22 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
