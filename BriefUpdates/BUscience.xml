The new research indicates that the giant ice sheet is more fragile than scientists had realized until the last few years -- and reveals increased risk of sea-level catastrophe in a warmer future.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2024 21:44:11 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>An Iceland volcano modifies its magma</title><link>https://new.nsf.gov/news/iceland-volcano-modifies-its-magma</link><image_url>https://lead-mark.github.io/snippets/genNewsImages/imageTwo.png</image_url><description>A team of NSF-funded researchers has discovered that an Iceland volcano changed how it formed magma as it continued to erupt from 2021 to 2022.

In their investigation of great white shark denticles, researchers found that ridge height and spacing play crucial roles in drag reduction at different swimming speeds. Higher middle ridges aid sharks in efficient cruising at slower speeds, while the lower side ridges become more critical for drag reduction during high-speed hunting bursts. The analysis also suggests that the speeds of an extinct giant shark, megalodon, may not much differ from those of the white shark.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2024 18:41:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>A thorny problem, a genetic answer</title><link>https://new.nsf.gov/news/thorny-problem-genetic-answer</link><image_url>https://lead-mark.github.io/snippets/genNewsImages/imageOne.png</image_url><description>Every rose has its thorn.

Many of them have already changed their own lifestyles or engaged in advocacy and protest, with even more being willing to do so in future. This is evident from a large-scale survey of scientists from all over the world.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2024 18:38:49 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
