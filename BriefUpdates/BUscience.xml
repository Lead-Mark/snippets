Increases are expected to be largest in countries where life expectancy is lower, contributing to a convergence of increased life expectancy across geographies. The trend is largely driven by public health measures that have prevented and improved survival rates from cardiovascular diseases, COVID-19, and a range of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases (CMNNs).</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 21:41:49 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>NSF planning major infrastructure overhaul to support future research in South Pole</title><link>https://new.nsf.gov/news/nsf-planning-major-infrastructure-overhaul-support</link><description>The U.S. National Science Foundation released the draft of its South Pole Station Master Plan (SPSMP), which will inform investments planned under the NSF Antarctic Infrastructure Recapitalization program and ensure that the mission and priorities of…</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2024 14:39:01 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>A trial HIV vaccine triggered elusive and essential antibodies in humans</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/05/240517111457.htm</link><image_url>https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-logo-rss.png</image_url><description>An HIV vaccine candidate triggered low levels of an elusive type of broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies among a small group of people enrolled in a 2019 clinical trial.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 16:14:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>NSF announces pilot phase and anticipated opening date of Arecibo C3 at the site of the NSF Arecibo Observatory Historic District in Puerto Rico</title><link>https://new.nsf.gov/news/nsf-announces-pilot-phase-anticipated-opening-date-of-arecibo</link><description>| En Español | As excitement builds for the grand opening of the new U.S. National Science Foundation Arecibo Center for Culturally Relevant and Inclusive Science Education, Computational Skills, and Community Engagement (NSF Arecibo C3), anticipated…</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2024 16:00:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>A powerful tool speeds success in achieving highly efficient thermoelectric materials</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/05/240516205155.htm</link><image_url>https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-logo-rss.png</image_url><description>Thermoelectric materials could play an important role in the clean energy transition, as they can produce electricity from sources of heat that would otherwise go to waste.
