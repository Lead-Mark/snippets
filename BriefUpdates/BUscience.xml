But there are many hydrothermal fields still to be discovered. During a 2022 expedition of the MARIA S. MERIAN, the first field of hydrothermal vents on the 500-kilometer-long Knipovich Ridge off the coast of Svalbard was discovered.</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jun 2024 17:52:50 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Deep-sea discovery opens up ocean of potential</title><link>https://new.nsf.gov/news/deep-sea-discovery-opens-ocean-potential</link><description>New research by U.S. National Science Foundation-funded scientists making use of NSF facilities has provided insight into how related ocean creatures have adapted to live in vastly different environments.

Despite its importance, the detailed evolutionary history of this biodiversity hotspot has remained largely a mystery. An international research team has now shed light on this history, reconstructing how biodiversity in the region has developed over the past 40 million years.</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jun 2024 17:52:23 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Physicists create first-ever Bose-Einstein condensate made of molecules</title><link>https://new.nsf.gov/news/physicists-create-first-ever-bose-einstein</link><description>A team of physicists has successfully created a unique quantum state of matter called a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) out of molecules.

The northward rain shift would be spurred by carbon emissions that influence the formation of the intertropical convergence zones that are essentially atmospheric engines that drive about a third of the world's precipitation.</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jun 2024 17:52:07 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
