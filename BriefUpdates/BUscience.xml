Researchers witnessed this process at the nanoscale for the first time with an electron microscope. By viewing the process with extreme precision, researchers discovered how to optimize it to generate water at a faster rate. Process could be used to generate water on-demand in arid environments, including on other planets.</description><pubDate>Mon, 30 Sep 2024 21:05:07 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>U.S. National Science Foundation and Department of Commerce announce a new $30M funding opportunity, funded by the CHIPS &amp; Science Act, to prepare talent for semiconductor jobs nationwide</title><link>https://new.nsf.gov/news/nsf-department-commerce-announce-30m-funding-opportunity</link><image_url>https://lead-mark.github.io/snippets/genNewsImagesTwo/Picture7.png</image_url><description>The Network Coordination Hub for the National Network for Microelectronics Education will establish and operate regional nodes to offer consistent, rigorous, engaging curricula, instructional materials, experiential opportunities, teacher…</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 20:42:31 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Could a bout of COVID protect you from a severe case of flu?</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/09/240930160208.htm</link><image_url>https://lead-mark.github.io/snippets/genNewsImagesTwo/Picture3.png</image_url><description>New findings on how past viral respiratory infections affect future, unrelated ones could lead to therapies for boosting general antiviral immunity -- and potentially pandemic preparedness.</description><pubDate>Mon, 30 Sep 2024 21:02:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>NSF and Quad partners launch AI-ENGAGE to encourage collaboration on emerging technologies and agriculture</title><link>https://new.nsf.gov/news/nsf-quad-partners-launch-ai-engage-encourage-collaboration</link><image_url>https://lead-mark.github.io/snippets/genNewsImagesTwo/Picture4.png</image_url><description>The U.S. National Science Foundation, Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), and Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization of Australia (CSIRO) signed a memorandum of cooperation…</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 17:50:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Frequent fizzy or fruit drinks and high coffee consumption linked to higher stroke risk</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/09/240930123035.htm</link><image_url>https://lead-mark.github.io/snippets/genNewsImagesTwo/Picture4.png</image_url><description>Frequent drinking of fizzy drinks or fruit juice is associated with an increased risk of stroke, according to new findings .
