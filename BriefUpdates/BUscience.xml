There's a new, improved two-dimensional material in the lab. Borophene, the atomically thin version of boron first synthesized in 2015, is more conductive, thinner, lighter, stronger and more flexible than graphene, the 2D version of carbon. Now, researchers have made the material potentially more useful by imparting chirality -- or handedness -- on it, which could make for advanced sensors and implantable medical devices.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2024 20:01:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>This week with NSF Director Panchanathan</title><link>https://new.nsf.gov/news/week-nsf-director-panchanathan-50</link><description>This week, Sethuraman Panchanathan, director of the U.S. National Science Foundation, has been actively forwarding science, education and engineering initiatives through meaningful collaborations with congressional leaders and NSF researchers.
