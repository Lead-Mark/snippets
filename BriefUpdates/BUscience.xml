Scientists have now deciphered the structure of the avian influenza virus's polymerase when it interacts with a human protein essential for the virus to replicate within the cell. The structure of this replication complex provides important information about the mutations that avian influenza polymerase must undergo to adapt to mammals, including humans. These results can help scientists monitor the evolution and adaptability of bird flu strains, such as H5N1 or H7N9, towards infecting other species.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 18:07:40 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Tropical glaciers now smallest in 11,700 years, scientists find</title><link>https://new.nsf.gov/news/tropical-glaciers-now-smallest-11700-years</link><image_url>https://lead-mark.github.io/snippets/genNewsImagesTwo/Picture7.png</image_url><description>Tropical glaciers, which are especially at risk from climate warming, have melted rapidly in recent decades.

Researchers look at buildings and other urban structures as physicists consider elements in complex material systems. With this insight, the researchers have developed a new approach to urban flood modelling and found their results helpful in analyzing city-to-city variations in flood risk globally.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 18:07:35 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>NSF invites K-12 students to design their own video games and compete for Game Maker Awards</title><link>https://new.nsf.gov/news/nsf-invites-k-12-students-design-their-own-video</link><image_url>https://lead-mark.github.io/snippets/genNewsImagesTwo/Picture9.png</image_url><description>The U.S. National Science Foundation announces the NSF Game Maker Awards "Life in 2100" competition for K-12 students.

Using molecular genetic methods, developmental biologists have now identified possible candidates for multipotent stem cells in the sea anemone for the first time. These stem cells are regulated by evolutionary highly conserved genes.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 18:07:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Studying the journey, not the destination, provides new insight into songbird migrations</title><link>https://new.nsf.gov/news/studying-journey-into-songbird-migrations</link><image_url>https://lead-mark.github.io/snippets/genNewsImagesTwo/Picture3.png</image_url><description>New research supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation using two decades worth of data could change how scientists think about bird migrations and the interdependencies and relationships they involve.

In fireflies of the species Abscondita terminalis, males make multi-pulse flashes with two lanterns to attract females, while females make single-pulse flashes with their one lantern to attract males. Now researchers have evidence that an orb-weaving spider (Araneus ventricosus) manipulates the flashing signals of male fireflies ensnared in its web such that they mimic the typical flashes of a female firefly, thereby luring other males to serve as their next meal.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 18:05:22 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
