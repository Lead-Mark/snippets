But researchers have now managed to create gold nanowires and develop soft electrodes that can be connected to the nervous system. The electrodes are soft as nerves, stretchable and electrically conductive, and are projected to last for a long time in the body.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2024 18:13:11 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>NSF promotes the transition to a circular economy in advanced materials</title><link>https://new.nsf.gov/news/nsf-promotes-transition-circular-economy-advanced</link><image_url>https://lead-mark.github.io/snippets/genNewsImages/imageTwo.png</image_url><description>The U.S. National Science Foundation, in partnership with Australia's national science agency, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), are investing in solutions that will accelerate the transition of materials…</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2024 15:00:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Smallest arm bone in human fossil record sheds light on the dawn of Homo floresiensis</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/08/240806131156.htm</link><image_url>https://lead-mark.github.io/snippets/genNewsImages/imageOne.png</image_url><description>A new study reports the discovery of extremely rare early human fossils from the Indonesian island of Flores, including an astonishingly small adult limb bone. Dated to about 700,000 years old, the new findings shed light on the evolution of Homo floresiensis, the so-called 'Hobbits' of Flores whose remains were uncovered in 2003 at Liang Bua cave in the island's west.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2024 18:11:56 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Celebrating two years of “Chips and Science”</title><link>https://new.nsf.gov/news/celebrating-two-years-chips-science</link><image_url>https://lead-mark.github.io/snippets/genNewsImages/imageTwo.png</image_url><description>NSF unleashed critical investments to support use-inspired research and innovation in key technology areas and to support solutions to pressing national, societal and geostrategic challenges, as articulated in the “CHIPS and Science Act of 2022.” The…</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2024 15:00:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Astronomers uncover risks to planets that could host life</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/08/240805164425.htm</link><image_url>https://lead-mark.github.io/snippets/genNewsImages/imageOne.png</image_url><description>A groundbreaking study has revealed that red dwarf stars can produce stellar flares that carry far-ultraviolet (far-UV) radiation levels much higher than previously believed.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2024 21:44:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>This week with NSF Director Panchanathan</title><link>https://new.nsf.gov/news/week-nsf-director-panchanathan-61</link><image_url>https://lead-mark.github.io/snippets/genNewsImages/imageThree.png</image_url><description>This week, NSF Director Sethuraman Panchanathan participated in key international and strategic dialogues, demonstrating NSF's leadership in fostering global partnerships and advancing cutting-edge research.

A new study suggests that water may have been able to flow into two shafts located inside the pyramid itself, where that water could have been used to help raise and lower a float used to carry the building stones.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2024 21:44:14 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>NSF invests $2.8M to strengthen technical AI education at two-year institutions</title><link>https://new.nsf.gov/news/nsf-invests-28m-strengthen-technical-ai-education</link><image_url>https://lead-mark.github.io/snippets/genNewsImages/imageTwo.png</image_url><description>The U.S. National Science Foundation has announced a grant of $2.8 million to establish a National Applied Artificial Intelligence Consortium (NAAIC) at Miami Dade College.

The new research indicates that the giant ice sheet is more fragile than scientists had realized until the last few years -- and reveals increased risk of sea-level catastrophe in a warmer future.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2024 21:44:11 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
