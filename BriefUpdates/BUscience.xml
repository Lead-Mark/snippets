This approach can produce more selective reactions with boron, and allows the use of directed evolution to improve its catalytic power.</description><pubDate>Wed, 08 May 2024 22:12:13 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Discovery in tomato could lead to natural pesticides</title><link>https://new.nsf.gov/news/discovery-tomato-could-lead-natural-pesticides</link><description>Like a slightly revised version of the movie "The Parent Trap," U.S. National Science Foundation-supported researchers from Michigan State University have discovered that tomato plants have two related but separate pathways for producing acylsugars…</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2024 20:40:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>'Wraparound' implants represent new approach to treating spinal cord injuries</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/05/240508140647.htm</link><description>A tiny, flexible electronic device that wraps around the spinal cord could represent a new approach to the treatment of spinal injuries, which can cause profound disability and paralysis. A team of engineers, neuroscientists and surgeons developed the devices and used them to record the nerve signals going back and forth between the brain and the spinal cord. Unlike current approaches, the new devices can record 360-degree information, giving a complete picture of spinal cord activity.</description><pubDate>Wed, 08 May 2024 19:06:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>NSF-led National AI Research Resource Pilot awards first round access to 35 projects in partnership with DOE</title><link>https://new.nsf.gov/news/nsf-led-national-ai-research-resource-pilot-awards</link><description>The U.S. National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy are thrilled to announce the first 35 projects that will be supported with computational time through the National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR) Pilot, marking a…</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2024 16:00:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Heavy snowfall and rain may contribute to some earthquakes</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/05/240508140638.htm</link><description>Episodes of heavy snowfall and rain likely contributed to a swarm of earthquakes over the past several years in northern Japan, researchers find.
