            "description": "Workers at the old Savannah River Site in South Carolina (once a factory for Cold War-era bomb guts) discovered a wasp nest hotter than your microwave burrito. Earlier this month, radiation monitors found the nest chilling near waste tanks, registering levels 10 times above federal limits. No wasps were harmed (or found), but the nest was bagged and tagged as radioactive waste. Officials say there's “no danger,” naturally, and blame “legacy contamination,” which is government speak for don’t ask too many questions. Watchdogs aren’t buying it and want to know where the radiation came from and whether mutant wasps are next. Spoiler: they’re not ruling it out. ",

            "description": "Chuck E. Chaos, a birthday brawl at a Mobile, Alabama Chuck E. Cheese left over 20 people bruised and bewildered, including a child who caught a surprise fist to the eye. Eyewitnesses say a teenage boy 'got upset about something' (as one does at a fine dining establishment known for skee-ball and sticky carpet), which quickly spiraled into an all-ages melee. No arrests—yet—but authorities are sniffing around for charges ranging from assault to criminal mischief. And if that weren’t enough, just weeks earlier in Florida, a Chuck E. Cheese employee dressed as the beloved mouse was busted for stealing a credit card while in costume. Because nothing says 'fun for the whole family' like felonies and black eyes. SMH.
