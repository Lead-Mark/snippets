            "description": "An Australian man is facing 20 criminal charges after allegedly stealing more than $100,000 worth of wagyu cattle semen, embryos, and livestock in what authorities are calling a modern-day cattle rustling case. Eric Fraser, 34, was employed by Sumo Wagyu Genetics when he was instructed to sell 200 'empty' heifers—cattle that can't carry calves. Instead, police say Fraser arranged for a third party to purchase 114 of the animals for himself, including 45 full-blood wagyu cows and heifers, which he sold at reduced prices for personal gain. During the investigation, authorities also recovered a liquid nitrogen tank containing valuable wagyu semen and embryos. Fraser is additionally accused of falsifying veterinary documents and neglecting six sick bulls, two of which later died. Both Fraser and a veterinarian involved are expected in court this August.

            "description": "Every July 1, Bobby Bonilla cashes in—literally—despite not having swung a bat since the 20th century. Thanks to a bizarre and now infamous contract with the New York Mets, the retired third baseman receives a $1.19 million payout every summer until 2035, all for delaying a $5.9 million payment back in 2000. The Mets thought they were being clever: invest the money with Bernie Madoff and rake in enough interest to make it a win-win. Except, well… that whole Ponzi scheme thing happened. The returns never came, but the deal with Bonilla stuck. So now, two and a half decades later, the Mets are still cutting checks—for a guy who hasn’t worn their uniform since Y2K. And if Bonilla kicks the bucket before 2035? The money keeps flowing to his family. Turns out he’s not the only one: other former MLB stars like Bret Saberhagen and Manny Ramírez have similar golden parachutes. The man’s batting average may be retired, but his bank account isn’t.",
