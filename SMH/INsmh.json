            "description": "In Rome, an 80 year old driver decided to take a detour straight down the city's historic Spanish Steps, promptly getting his luxury Mercedes stuck halfway. Shockingly sober, he was cited on the spot, while firefighters had the joy of removing the stranded car with a crane. Weirdly enough, local police would not volunteer if the man was using a navigation system. Hmmm. Turns out, the 18th-century landmark, famously seen in countless films and postcards, isn't designed for shortcuts. SMH. Think I'm exaggerating? There's only one way to find out.",

            "description": "In the latest 'tech gone wrong' saga, a mom of two got hit with a whopping $5,800 parking charge after spending just two hours at a shopping center. Instead of paying about $5.70, a faulty machine decided to withdraw exactly $5,807 (yes, you read that right) from her account. Even though management called it an 'isolated incident,' it still took a radio show intervention and three stressful weeks for the poor woman to get her cash back. Who knew convenience could cost the price of a used car? SMH. ",
