            "description": "Some people unfollow their family—Audrey Backeberg unsubscribed entirely. Apparently, disappearing for six decades is easier than returning your family's calls. Audrey Backeberg, a 20-year-old Wisconsin mom who vanished in 1962, has finally been found alive—just not interested in being found. After six decades of family grief, wild theories, and even one forensic dog on the case, it took a detective and a bit of DNA sleuthing to uncover that she’s been quietly living in another state, by choice. No foul play, no dramatic reveal—just a woman who walked away from a reportedly abusive marriage, boarded a Greyhound, and never looked back. Now in her 80s, she’s happy, healthy, and wants to stay off the radar. Just call it pulling off the ultimate Irish goodbye. SMH. Read for yourself.",

            "description": "Johan Helberg, a man so chill he might be cryogenically preserved, didn’t even flinch when a 135-meter container ship bulldozed into his front garden—stopping just shy of his house. Authorities say there were no injuries, no oil spills, and no logical explanation for how a floating behemoth ended up parked like a misplaced Amazon delivery. Helberg only woke up when a neighbor rang the doorbell and told him... Authorities are now investigating how a ship forgot where the ocean ends and real estate begins, though everyone aboard insists it was just another day at the office. Don’t believe me? Click below.",
