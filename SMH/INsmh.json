            "description": "Move over, Ocean’s Eleven, New Zealand just got a one-cat heist crew, and his name is Leonardo da Pinchy. That’s right, in a world already teetering on the edge, now we’ve got a kleptomaniac tabby swiping socks, silk drawers, and even a $181 cashmere sweater like he’s prepping for a fashion forward feline runway. Residents of Auckland’s Mairangi Bay aren’t even mad—some are apparently offended he hasn’t robbed them yet. His owner, meanwhile, is fielding “Are these your undies?” texts like it’s just another Tuesday. You thought cats were aloof? Try one that raids your laundry line before the shops open. SMH.",

            "description": "According to a woman known online as Cassie, the world’s going up in smoke (possibly nuclear or celestial) thanks to a ghost named “7” she met during a bored Ouija session back in 2013. For the past 12 years, she and her husband (who apparently prefers anonymity) have been chatting with this multilingual spirit, who speaks in backwards binary code, ancient tongues, and vague warnings like “Stop stupid.” The kicker? 7 says humanity had two previous cosmic close calls: Hiroshima and the Cuban Missile Crisis. Cassie’s dropped a 51-page ghost transcript and insists this isn’t for clout, just a good ol’ end of days PSA... helpfully posted after she went viral. SMH.",
