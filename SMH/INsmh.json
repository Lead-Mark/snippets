            "description": "So Advanced, It Doesn’t Need You Anymore. Turns out that diploma and four years of ramen noodles might just earn you…unemployment. While everyone’s pointing fingers at Trump’s tariffs for a sluggish job market, the real culprit slipping under the radar is A.I. Entry-level tech gigs are vanishing faster than a college grad’s optimism, as companies replace fresh faces with lines of code and chatbot interns.

Nintendo’s Switch 2 hit shelves at the stroke of midnight, prompting global fanfare, musical performances, and cosplay that would make your uncle roll his eyes so hard he’d sprain something. The scenes? Lines wrapped around buildings, celebratory whoops, and thirtysomethings crying tears of joy over the chance to drop $400 on a handheld device that’s already behind in graphics. SMH.",
