            "link": "https://www.aol.com/news/tesla-wants-us-withhold-answers-161117317.html",
            "description": "Tesla, is busy deploying robotaxis (self driving cars) around Austin, Texas. But don’t worry, it's none of your business how safe they are. Tesla told federal regulators that details about the safety performance of these self driving taxis are confidential. The company warned that revealing the info might allow rivals or 'nefarious actors' to smear their reputation, or steal trade secrets. Meanwhile, regulators are still investigating Tesla's software because of some previous wrecks. Apparently, r obots driving in the fog are a tad risky. And yet, Elon Musk has already unleashed these driverless taxis onto unsuspecting Austinites, complete with influencer test rides. Tesla stock is soaring, of course, because what's safer than a tech company refusing to share safety data? Profit over safety yet again. SMH. Think I’m exaggerating? Read for yourself.",

            "description": "A New York high school graduation turned heads this weekend when 15 sets of twins crossed the stage to receive diplomas. The Class of 2025 at Plainview-Old Bethpage John F. Kennedy High School surprised attendees who hadn’t realized there was such a high twin population, until some parents started calling it out during the ceremony. School officials confirmed it wasn't their first multiple twin graduation, but this year DID break records. It just makes you wonder, just what's in the water out there on Long Island? SMH.",
