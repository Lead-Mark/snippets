            "link": "https://futurism.com/lonely-children-ai-chatbots",
            "description": "Some kids are now turning to AI chatbots for companionship—because apparently, human friends are just too analog. A new report shows two-thirds of children aged 9 to 17 regularly chat with bots like ChatGPT and Character.AI, and over a third of those say it feels like talking to an actual friend. Worse, 12% admit they do it because they’ve got no one else. These AI buddies aren't just chatting about homework—they’re dishing out empathy to teens struggling with eating disorders and family drama, even pretending they once had childhood trauma themselves. Experts are waving red flags, warning that kids can't tell where the machine ends and the “friend” begins.",

            "description": "Scientists have unearthed a 12-sided bronze bauble with holes, knobs, and zero instructions. They can’t agree if it’s a candle holder, a cosmic decoder ring, or ancient junk drawer filler. Since the first one showed up in 1739, over 120 have been found scattered across former Roman provinces, and none of them make a lick of sense. Theories range from weapons to sacred symbols, but the artifacts’ pristine condition and fancy craftsmanship suggest they weren’t exactly DIY measuring cups. Some scholars, channeling their inner Plato, think they represent the universe itself. Others? They’re just shrugging in Latin",
