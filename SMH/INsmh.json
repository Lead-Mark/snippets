            "description": "Potato farmer Graham Bannister nearly met his end while trying to set up Starlink Satellite Service at his off-grid dream home. However, during said setup, one misstep in his garden sent him crashing into a shrub that skewered his side, and with no cell signal for miles, things could’ve gone very badly, very fast. But thanks to the very satellite internet he was installing, he managed to crawl back inside, use Wi-Fi calling to reach emergency services, and share his exact location Surgery followed, but so did survival. The same tech that almost took him out ended up saving his life. SMH.",

            "description": "In a post WWI America trying to sell patriotism and savings in one shot, a Fargo bank decided the best way to get kids excited about thrift was to hand them deactivated actual hand grenades... converted into coin banks. Any child under 17 who signed a “thrift agreement” and bought a war savings stamp could take one home. It was part war souvenir, part marketing gimmick, part financial lesson, and 100% a reminder that we've always used strange props to teach kids adult ideas. And you thought handing kids iPads was questonable parenting. SMH. Read for yourself.",
