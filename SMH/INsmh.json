            "link": "https://apnews.com/article/britain-gold-toilet-theft-court-trial-sentence-3a3955da078af343596606e07addc305",
            "description": "A man in England helped some thieves try to sell a working toilet made of solid gold—yes, a real toilet you can actually use. It was worth $6.4 million and was stolen in 2019 from a fancy old house where Winston Churchill was born. The golden potty was part of an art piece called America, meant to make fun of rich people. It had even been offered to President Trump once (seriously). The toilet has never been found and was probably melted down. The man who helped try to sell it just got community service, not jail, because the judge said he didn’t know it was stolen. SMH. Look it up yourself.",

            "description": "Remember that lady who cried in the woods with a snotty nose in The Blair Witch Project? Well, she’s back in the forest—but this time in Maine, marking trees and starting drama in a town called (wait for it) Freedom. Heather Donahue ditched Hollywood, beat addiction, became a weed farmer, and ended up on her town’s Select Board—until locals booted her in a recall over her painting orange blazes on trees to prove a road was public. Some folks say she was right. Others say she was just too weird for a town of 700. Either way, the spooky part isn’t the forest—it’s how fast a town can turn on you when you mess with their trails. SMH. Read more below",
