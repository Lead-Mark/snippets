            "description": "Apparently, Amazon MGM is throwing a cool $2 billion (yes, with a 'b') at movies and TV shows for 2026, claiming they're 'heavily invested in theatrical.' That's right, the same company that practically invented staying home in your pajamas to watch everything is now insisting you'll be dragging yourself to a movie theater for their latest Ryan Gosling flick or another Lord of the Rings snooze-fest. They're even bragging about The Rings of Power being the 'most expensive TV series ever made,' which explains why our Prime subscriptions keep going up. And get this, they're not 'holding any content back,' which sounds like a threat, not a promise. SMH. Read for yourself.",
