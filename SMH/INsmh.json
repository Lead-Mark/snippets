            "link": "https://www.odditycentral.com/news/father-of-the-year-fakes-dna-test-to-avoid-paying-125000-in-child-support.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=father-of-the-year-fakes-dna-test-to-avoid-paying-125000-in-child-support",
            "description": "Just when you thought deadbeat dad stories couldn’t get any messier, a UK man—clearly gunning for “Father of the Year”—faked a DNA test with the help of a shady lab tech to skip out on over $125,000 in child support. Sheldon B. dumped his partner Chelsea Miller three days after she gave birth, then denied being the father and miraculously got a test to “prove” it. But Chelsea wasn’t buying it and recruited Sheldon’s own mom to take a grandparent DNA test—which blew the scam wide open. Turns out Sheldon got a buddy of his aunt’s to literally swap spit at the lab. The co-conspirators? Now enjoying matching fraud convictions and a few cozy months behind bars. Justice? Sort of. But hey, maybe next time get a receipt with your DNA results. SMH. Read for yourself.",

            "description": "Minot, North Dakota—population 50,000—is currently being outnumbered by what sounds like a Pixar subplot gone wrong: an exploding colony of Richardson’s ground squirrels. These prairie-dwelling pests have tunneled their way into every nook of town, from downtown sidewalks to airport runways—even the Minot Air Force Base, home to nuclear missiles, is infested. Locals are battling what’s essentially a fuzzy insurgency, with pest control workers gassing holes and sniping rodents like it’s D-Day for groundhogs. But thanks to high birth rates, no predators, and a surprising number of squirrel sympathizers who think they’re “too cute,” this war’s looking more like a slow surrender. SMH.",
