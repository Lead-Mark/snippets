            "description": "In a world obsessed with viral chaos and celebrity meltdowns, leave it to Sweden to score blockbuster ratings by livestreaming… absolutely nothing. That’s right, nine million viewers tuned in last year—and millions more are expected this year—to watch a bunch of moose (meese? no it's definatley moose...?) slowly migrate through the forest and take a leisurely swim across a River. No car chases, no reality show meltdowns, not even a dramatic antler duel. Just 500 hours of calm, meandering “slow TV,” where the big cliffhanger is whether a moose will take the plunge before sunset. Meanwhile, 15 people are on the clock making sure this forest-footage-fest stays stress-free and soothing. It’s nature’s version of watching paint dry—if the paint had hooves and weighed 900 pounds. SMH. See for yourself.",
