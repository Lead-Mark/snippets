            "description": "Your midnight gas runs, slow nozzle squeezes, and sweaty drives with the A/C off are about as effective as yelling at the fuel gauge. AAA and actual engineers confirm what common sense should have told us ages ago, underground fuel tanks don’t care if it’s dawn or dusk (the temperature stays stable), Pumping gas at a snail’s pace doesn’t magically give you more bang for your buck either. The pump’s meter measures what goes in, period. And for everyone rolling the windows down on the highway and turning off the air conditioning, congratulations: you’ve turned your car into a flying hot brick, instead of a cool, comfortable vehicle. Meanwhile, prices keep setting records no matter how many myths you chase down the road. SMH",

Dr. Natasha Fernando says you should grab a cold glass of milk instead, claiming its proteins, sugars, fats, and even sodium help you stay hydrated longer than boring old water. Plant-based milk works too, if you’re that person. Just don’t expect to find it in the sports drink aisle anytime soon. Skeptical? SMH. Read for yourself.",
