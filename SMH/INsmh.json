            "description": "This new commuter bridge in India (which to be honest, is a free for all already when it comes to driving), has a 90 degree turn. The Government has fired and blacklisted the engineers involved in the project, which would be an appropriate measure, if the bridge itself hadn't been under construction for 10 years!! How do you not notice a hard right turn is making it's debut, when it appears gradually over a decade? Not to mention there HAD to have been blueprints before any of this went down. Maybe the review process needs reviewing, because firing the people who built the thing you approved kind of misses the point. SMH.",

            "description": "A Pittsburgh home partially collapsed this week (just as everyone involved predicted it would) after a year of bureaucratic limbo left the owners begging the city for permission to tear it down. The building, located in the Manchester historic district, had been flagged by its structural engineer (who, fun twist, is the owner's son) as a “public safety risk” back in December 2024. Despite repeated pleas, reports, and warnings (including one letter that bluntly said it might “self-demolish”), the city tangled itself in red tape over preservation, zoning, and who knows what else. And now? The back of the house has conveniently handled the demolition itself. The city council president says the process should’ve moved faster and blames a lack of resources. Meanwhile, the owners are still being told they need a permit... to finish tearing down what gravity already started. SMH. Read for yourself.",
