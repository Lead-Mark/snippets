            "description": "So much for fun in the sun—Royal Caribbean’s Navigator of the Seas just wrapped up a cruise that left over 140 passengers and crew battling what’s likely norovirus, though officials are still “investigating”. The ship, which left L.A. for a Mexican getaway on July 4, returned with a boatload of vomiting, diarrhea, and disappointed tourists. The CDC hasn’t nailed down the culprit, but if it walks like a stomach flu and pukes like a stomach flu… you get the picture. This isn’t even the first time this has happened on one of their ships—last September, 180 folks got sick on a similar “adventure.” But don’t worry, Royal Caribbean says your health is their top priority—right after the bottom line, of course. Don’t believe me? Read for yourself",

Where? In the Police Department parking lot. Officers were already stepping outside to help the woman when Mr. Tillman’s car hit the cruiser. He then fled the scene like he wasn’t being recorded in 4K. He was later found, still allegedly under the influence, and racked up charges including OUI, resisting arrest, hit-and-run, and driving to endanger",
