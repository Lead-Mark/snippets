            "description": "Somewhere in Slovenia, a bronze statue of Melania Trump has vanished—sawed off at the ankles and carted away like yesterday’s recycling. Erected near her hometown after the original wooden version was set on fire (subtle), the statue never exactly wowed the locals. One nearby baker bluntly said nobody, not even Melania herself, seemed all that fond of the thing. Maybe it was the lack of resemblance, or maybe it was the vague haunted energy of commemorating someone who moved halfway across the world and never looked back. Either way, the police are “investigating,” and the rest of Sevnica appears to be shrugging. SMH. Look it up yourself.",

            "description": "In a move that perfectly encapsulates the spirit of “it’s fine, I got this,” a Houston couple decided to tow their broken-down Saab with a chain—on a freeway—after skipping the towing company to save a few bucks. But when the Saab’s axle gave out mid-haul, the car began swerving like a caffeinated toddler on roller skates, zigzagging across lanes in a now-viral video that screams, “Darwin Awards, meet TikTok.” Eyewitnesses were treated to a chaotic display of shouting, hood-slapping, and baffling mechanics—like towing the car from the back, which, as one onlooker politely noted, “makes zero sense.” No tickets were issued, but the man was arrested on an unrelated warrant because, of course he was. SMH. Look it up yourself.",
