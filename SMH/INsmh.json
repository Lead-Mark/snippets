            "description": "Some folks clock in at Family Dollar, others clock out criminals—just maybe not like this. In Indianapolis, a store worker decided he’d moonlight as vigilante security, chasing down a thief on a bike and shooting him square in the buttocks after a brief dollar-store manhunt. Jerome Stepp, the trigger-happy employee, now faces felony charges while the actual thief got away with a bruised ego and some bullet-caused ventilation. Moral of the story? Turns out you can get fired for going above and beyond. SMH. Read for yourself.",

Detroit’s Asja Outerbridge joined her misdemeanor hearing rocking a robe and multitasking while making a sandwhich, only to get booted by a visibly angered Judge Sean Perkins. Her excuse? She had the wrong time (she didn't) and she was taking care of her child. Treating her court hearing like a casual FaceTime call. SMH.",
