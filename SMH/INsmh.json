Silicon Valley pedestrians recently found themselves guided across the street by deepfake Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg voices, courtesy of a hacked accessibility system. Officials blame the password that was set to log into the system: 1234. Yes really. 1234. It is promised the issue’s fixed, at least until the next person tries to hack in using 0000. Officials say they've updated security, but with a track record like this, confidence isn't exactly high. SMH.",

            "description": "Just when you thought camping couldn’t get any more inconvenient, Colorado's White River National Forest has banned tents from their Campground. This comes after a black bear gave two kids a nighttime scare, all while their parents blissfully slept nearby. Now everyone who camps there must swap their cozy canvas for clunky trailers. Because, apparently, bears are picky eaters who won’t touch anything with aluminum siding. Forest Service officials remind campers that 'The bears were here first'. And let's be honest, the true joy of camping has always been… not camping.",
