            "description": "In a shocking twist no one saw coming, snack giant Mondelez (aka Nabisco), home of Oreo, Chips Ahoy, and Wheat Thinsis suing Aldi for making its off-brand cookies look too much like the real deal. According to the lawsuit, Aldi’s bargain-bin doppelgängers are so visually similar, they’re practically snack-shaped identity theft. Think “Thin Wheat” instead of Wheat Thins, with the same yellow box and cheerful cracker glamor shots. Mondelez says it’s tired of getting bamboozled by Aldi’s “identical” packaging and wants the courts to shut it down. But here’s a thought: maybe people aren’t confused... maybe they just like paying less for the same crunchy regret. SMH. Read for yourself.",

            "description": "Maybe the candy aisle needs a DEA agent. Turns out those cute little fizzy cola gummies from Haribo were packing more than just sugar! Some were laced with cannabis and accidentally sold in stores, with incidents in Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Jamaica. After some kids got sick (yeah, kids), Haribo is scrambling to figure out how Mary Jane ended up crashing the candy party. It's being called a “precautionary recall.But the question for you, the reader is: Are you now staying away from these gummies for a moment, or leaving right now to go to the store?",
