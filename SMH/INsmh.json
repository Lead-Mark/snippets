            "description": "Turns out, the cure for deadly snakebites wasn’t hiding in a fancy lab—it was crawling up the arm of a guy who made YouTube videos in his garage. Meet Tim Friede, a self-made “antivenom factory” who spent 18 years getting bitten by venomous snakes—200 times and counting—just to turn his immune system into a medical marvel. After a couple of cobra bites left him in a coma (you know, as hobbies do), Tim’s masochistic science project actually worked: researchers used his blood to whip up a snakebite treatment that’s beating the odds where traditional antivenom flops. And here we thought DIY was just for shelves. SMH. Look it up yourself.",
