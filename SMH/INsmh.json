            "description": "So a Google Street View car cruised through a sleepy Argentinian town back in 2017 and accidentally snapped a local cop's bare behind while he was sunning his junk in the privacy of his own yard. Fast forward to now: after years of courtroom ping-pong, a higher court decided that yes, maybe being publicly pants-less on a global mapping platform does qualify as a privacy violation, especially when your address is visible and your coworkers won’t let it go.

            "description": "While other ag schools are downsizing their cow colleges, Michigan State University just herded 80 dairy divas into a shiny new $75 million bovine bachelor pad, complete with milking parlors, high-tech labs, and room for nearly 700 mooing roommates. Touted as a “21st century cattle drive,” this cow-muter relocation involves claps and whistles (yes, really) and aims to fix a two year research backlog caused by MSU’s glorified barn from the 1960s. Backed by Michigan’s dairy obsessed economy (and let’s be real, ice cream politics), this facility milks both nostalgia and funding.
