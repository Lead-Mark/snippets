            "description": "In England’s annual homage to chaos disguised as tradition, thrill-seekers hurled themselves down a muddy 200-yard hill chasing a runaway wheel of cheese—because why use stairs when you can risk a concussion? German YouTuber Tom Kopke claimed victory (again), tumbling into first place like a human tumbleweed and proudly clutching his seven-pound prize like it was Olympic gold. Meanwhile, the women’s champ somersaulted her way into fame, bonked her head, and still called it a win. Dressed in morph suits and delusions of glory, competitors once again proved that gravity is undefeated. Broken bones? Likely. Dignity? Not so much. SMH. Read for yourself.",

Now, tech junkies can feed it a 'prompt' - (a sentence or two), and get back a full-blown life-like scene. Fooled by a video of 100 dogs doing a synchronized dance in China? Just wait until you’re nodding along to a heartwarming clip of Tom Hanks rescuing a dolphin from a flooded Walmart—only to find out it was cooked up by A.I. with no soul and too much free time. The line between real and ridiculous just got blurrier. SMH. Your heads up below",
