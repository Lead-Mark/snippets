            "description": "In yet another episode of 'Why You Should Close the Door All the Way,' a Colorado influencer named Miracle Man Cash—because of course that’s his name—nearly had a spiritual experience when an 8-foot bull snake decided to crash his office. Mistaking it for a rattler (because who wouldn’t?), he squealed, recorded the whole thing, and posted it for his loyal followers who promptly turned into amateur herpetologists. Turns out the snake was harmless, just big, bored, and apparently excellent at exploiting a two-inch gap in door security. Nature strikes again, this time in your WFH setup. SMH. Read for yourself.",

            "description": "Hope you weren’t planning to grow old with The Last of Us, because by the time Season 3 drops, you might actually BE the last of us (see what I did there?). HBO’s hit fungus-fueled drama finished season 2 last night, only to leave fans stranded with what's going to be a two-and-a-half-year wait before the story limps back in 2027—maybe. Why? Because filming won’t even start until 2026, and if past seasons are any clue, post-production takes longer than a DMV line on a Monday (but next Monday, DMV is closed today). This wouldn't sting so much if they weren’t splitting a single game’s plot across two glacially paced seasons. So now we wait, again. Don’t believe me? Go look at a calendar and weep. SMH.
