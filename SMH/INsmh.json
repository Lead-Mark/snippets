            "description": "Two explorers in Upstate New York hit the panic button to report their buddy had died. Plot twist: they were just high out of their minds on magic mushrooms, and their allegedly deceased pal was not only alive and well, but coherent enough to call and let authorities know he was in fact, not dead. First responders found and carted the duo off to the hospital while their very-much-alive friend had a peaceful day without them. Don’t believe me? SMH read for yourself.",

            "description": "Just when you thought American culture couldn’t grill up anything more absurd, the Oscar Mayer Wienermobiles—yes, the giant hot dog on wheels—held a serious race at the legendary Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Dubbed the “Wienie 500,” six of these meat-torpedo mascots burned rubber at a blistering 65 mph in a battle for sausage supremacy. The car “Slaw Dog,” was the winner by half a bun, proving once and for all that even in a world plagued by actual problems, there’s always time to cheer for meat in motion. Nearly 80,000 people watched this miracle of marketing unfold like it was the moon landing. SMH.",
