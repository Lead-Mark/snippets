            "description": "In their never-ending quest to make air travel just a bit more stressful, United Airlines has decided you now need to check in at LEAST 45 minutes before your domestic flight. Effective June 3, if you’re one of those carry-on-only, beat-the-clock travelers, consider your wiggle room officially shrunk. The excuse? “Well everyone else is doing it!” United claims—aligning the new check-in deadline with the existing baggage cut-off is what “most” airlines do (translation: not all, but enough to justify it). International flights are still at the one-hour mark, so yay for predictability? Bottom line: show up earlier, or risk getting endlessly rebooked. SMH.",

Yes. That is a thing. Apparently. Locals and out-of-towners alike braved weather and their dignity to beat a German-held record from 2019, complete with singing songs and, apparently, beer-swigging grandmas in full Smurfette regalia. The mayor got in on it too, so you know, nothing was going on that day apparently. SMH, read it for yourself.",
