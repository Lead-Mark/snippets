            "description": "In a plot that sounds like a rejected Netflix crime doc, Spanish police busted a couple in Mallorca for allegedly running an online exotic cat smuggling business. Authorities seized 19 wild animals—including a caracal and two servals—and found more than 40 phony animal passports from places like Russia, Belarus, and China. The suspects were reportedly offering up everything from white tigers to black leopards for sale on social media, asking as much as €60,000 per cat, because nothing screams “responsible pet ownership” like a clouded leopard in your living room. The animals are now headed to a rescue center, presumably where they won’t be taught to sit for Instagram. Sound unbelievable? Read the article for yourself, I just work here.",
