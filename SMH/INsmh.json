The Friday morning crash near Shrewsbury, PA, shut down traffic, bruised four unlucky commuters (non-fatally), and forced emergency crews into the dubious honor of shoveling warm, road-slicked franks into a dump truck. Even the fire chief had to admit the scene was a joke, though one that came with greasy boots and unexpected hot dog physics. SMH.",
