            "description": "A 42-year-old man learned he was legally married to his ex-fiancée, (after breaking up with her) thanks to a Bath & Body Works gift bag sent his way that included lotion, a marriage license, and a photo of his ex proudly holding the signed marriage certificate. Apparently, Kristin Marie Spearman wasn’t taking the breakup well, and somehow managed to file a legit marriage license without the groom, using a cooperative pastor and some creative paperwork. The man, who never said “I do,” is now untangling the legal mess while wondering how on earth you can get hitched without showing up. SMH",

            "description": "In Broward County, Florida (where common sense often goes to retire), a gas station clerk allegedly shot a customer in the leg after a heated argument about the price of beer. According to deputies, 46-year-old Abdulla Monther pulled a SIG Sauer from under the counter and fired after the customer tossed what might’ve been a piece of paper at him. Surveillance footage backs it up, and Monther didn’t stop there, he reportedly hurled a racial slur and followed the injured man around with the gun still drawn. All this… over beer. SMH.
