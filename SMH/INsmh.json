            "description": "'Just end him' is not the conversation you want to be overhearing on the playground. Four girls, ages 10 and 11, at Legacy Traditional School in Surprise, Arizona, are accused of planning to stab a male classmate in a school bathroom. According to police, the fifth graders came up with the plot during lunch and recess, allegedly motivated by a breakup and cheating rumors. Each girl had a role: one would bring the knife, one would write a fake suicide note, and another would act as a lookout. The plan was discovered when other students reported what they overheard. The next day, the girls’ backpacks were searched, and they were questioned with their parents. All four were arrested for threatening and disorderly conduct. While three expressed remorse, one reportedly laughed and made excuses. Experts say young brains and exposure to violence online may play a role in such behavior. The girls were suspended and face expulsion. SMH. Read for yourself.",

            "description": "Just when you thought public pools couldn’t get more questionable, New Yorkers proved otherwise. Last summer, New York City had to shut down its public pools a total of over 200 times because people defecated in them. The closures affected 44 out of 52 pools, the total amount of closure hours being 600 hours of lost pool time. Most of the incidents involved solid waste, but 19 were more serious “liquid stool” events that forced pools to close for at least a full day. The worst hit location was Lyons Pool on Staten Island, which had 15 separate incidents all in last year. Health rules require lifeguards to clear the pool, remove the waste, and disinfect the water thoroughly after each event. As the 2025 summer season begins, will a record be broken (good or bad)? Only time will tell. SMH",
