            "description": "Meet Hercules and Ned, two border collies with official airport jobs and more hustle than most office workers. Their gig? Patrolling the runways of West Virginia’s busiest airport to scare off birds, bats, and whatever else Mother Nature throws at air traffic (apprently the planes themselves don't do that). It sounds like a punchline, but these dogs are the front line in preventing wildlife-plane collisions—a real thing that’s taken down jets and delayed flights nationwide. Hercules, now a seasoned pro with his own fanbase, even pulls double duty as a stress therapist, comforting anxious passengers with tail wags and wet-nosed pep talks. So now the real question is: if dogs can keep planes on time and passengers calm, what exactly are the other employees doing? SMH.",

            "description": "Ever sat on a plane, heard a mysterious ding, and braced for impact like it was Morse code for “good luck”? According to Captain Steve (yes that's his real name!) —a Navy vet turned airline pilot and now a YouTube explainer-in-chief, says those chimes are just polite nudges to the flight attendants: like time to sit, time to serve, and time to stash your stuff before landing. So in short, subtle dings, mean sutble things. And those “black boxes” everyone whispers about? Turns out, not black, but bright orange. His series may be able to help you relax or give you better clarity for the next time you fly. Read for yourself.",
