            "description": "Just when you thought New Jersey couldn’t get any weirder, turns out there's a hill in Sparta where the trees are decorated not with leaves, but with frying pans. Locals call it the Frying Pan Forest (not cookware graveyard?) No one really knows how it started. Aome blame rebellious Girl Scouts, others claim it’s haunted, or maybe just an elaborate joke that got out of hand. Whatever the origin, it’s now a hotspot for Geocachers and curious hikers looking to bask in the eerie clang of aluminum and confusion. Don’t believe me? Click Below",

            "description": "Well folks, it’s a big day in North Dakota: the state’s historic sites are finally trading in their pit toilets for ones that, actually flush. After years of treating visitors to 19th-century bathroom realism, the State Historical Society is proudly rolling out indoor plumbing at places at all the states historical sites. With a price tag of $150,000 per throne, the state is bringing modern luxuries to places where 'history didn’t' which is a nice way of saying “middle of nowhere.”",
