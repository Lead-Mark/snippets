            "description": "In today’s edition of “Who’s Saving Who,” a veterinary student in Melbourne took in a 13-year-old dog dumped at a shelter to be euthanized, and proceeded to have her entire soul rearranged by a scrappy Maltese-Poodle named Lacey. With more backstory than an HBO miniseries and only one tooth to her name, Lacey moved in, took over the house (and the bed), and proceeded to give her new human a crash course in love, loss, and the power of granny-knit sweaters. Nine months later, Lacey passed on, but not before proving, once again, that old dogs might not learn new tricks, but they will absolutely wreck your emotional stability.",

            "description": "Well folks, dreams do come true... if your dream is to have your name immortalized above a public urinal. John Fritz, the behind-the-scenes hero of the Clark County Historical Society (and husband to the actual archivist), finally saw his long running gag come to life with a plaque in the men’s room. That’s right... years of Facebook birthday fundraisers led to this golden moment: a tribute above a toilet, all in the name of preserving history. They even held a dedication ceremony in the bathroom, because of course they did. It’s the kind of local heartwarming absurdity that makes you wonder what kind of legacy you’re leaving behind. SMH.
