            "description": "In a world where clout is currency, one woman decided that a drop in her Instagram follower count was grounds for a police complaint against her own husband. Nisha, a self-declared Reel queen, accused hubby Vijendra of sabotaging her social media career by expecting her to do house chores instead of filming dance videos. She stormed out, moved back in with her parents, and filed an official complaint, citing a devastating two-follower loss as proof of emotional turmoil. Not to be outdone, Vijendra fired back with his own grievance: that his wife cared more about likes than laundry. After a police counseling session, the couple made up, just in time for Vijendra to lose his job in the fallout. SMH. Read for yourself.",

            "description": "A man went to the hospital with severe stomach pain and left with quite a story. Doctors discovered a live eel swimming in his abdominal cavity. The 33-year-old patient had a hardened stomach and signs of a dangerous infection, prompting emergency surgery. During the procedure, surgeons were stunned to find the eel had pierced through his intestines and was moving freely among his organs. They safely removed it and cleaned the area to prevent further issues. The man recovered and was discharged, but officials didn’t explain how the eel got there.",
