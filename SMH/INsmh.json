            "description": "According to conspiracy loving Instagrammer Maverick Bailey, every new flavor of Dew introduced seems to line up with disasters: Maui Blast before the Maui wildfires, Star Spangled Splash before a bridge collapse, and Pitch Black right before a global IT meltdown. Now, with new flavor Baja Midnight on the horizon (exclusive to Taco Bell) Bailey‚Äôs warning of a ‚Äúmidnight‚Äù catastrophe, possibly even paranormal. And just to stoke the flames, Mountain Dew OFFICIALLY responded with a cryptic message: ‚ÄúKeep your voice down üëÄ.‚Äù Coincidence or carbonated curse? SMH. Read for yourself.",

            "description": "A teen named Anna Jones went viral after revealing she flew from Austin to Nashville with over 200 tortillas in her backpack. The reason? It‚Äôs a family tradition. Her dad stocks her up whenever she visits Texas so she can bring them home, freeze them, and use them for months. According to Jones, TSA agents didn‚Äôt question the carry-on, and TikTok users quickly shared their own stories of flying tortillas across the globe. The tortillas‚Äô cult status stems from their connection to H-E-B, a Texas-based grocery chain beloved for its fresh, flavorful products. Don't believe me? Link below.",
