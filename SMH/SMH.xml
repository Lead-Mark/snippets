            <description>MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Hundreds of bagpipers claimed a new world record on Wednesday by belting out AC/DC’s rock and roll classic “It’s a Long Way to the Top.” Billed as “The Great Melbourne Bagpipe Bash,” the eclectic performance took place in Melbourne’s Federation Square, on Swanston Street, which was the scene of the Australian hard rock band’s 1976 film clip in which they played the hit on the back of a flatbed truck traveling slowly through downtown traffic with music blaring from speakers.</description>

            <description>A woman has spent around £20,000 plumping up her pout – but this isn't the only cost she's suffered in her quest to get the "world's biggest lips". Andrea Ivanova has had hyaluronic acid injections in the chin, jawline and cheekbones, as well as a breast augmentation operation with 600cc silicone implants. What's more, she gets lip filler every single month without fail. The 28-year-old has lost count of how many times she's got injected and spends hundreds each month on appointments.</description>
