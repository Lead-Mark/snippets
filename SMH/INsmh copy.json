            "description": "Price, Utah just delivered a reality-TV fever dream: 52-year-old Rogelio Bustillos barged into a house on two seperate nights, quizzing three sleepy men who lived there at gunpoint about whether they’d gotten cozy with his wife. He eventually made them ride their bicycles to their place of work so he could make a getaway. He was eventually nabbed in a multi-agency manhunt. While being booked into Jail, Bustillos was asked whether he had any drugs or weapons on him. He denied having anything, but officers later serached his car and found two firearms and 16 grams of cocaine. When confronted, he reportedly said, 'Oh, that’s my cocaine. Just throw that out.'",

Slot machine technicians, the unsung heroes of your Grandma's quarter collection, are keeping AI at bay. Turns out robots aren’t great at patience, nuance, or 'dumb luck' when it comes to repairs. As casinos bet heavily on automated security, digital concierges, and AI designed games, there are still some things the Terminator can't control quite yet.",
