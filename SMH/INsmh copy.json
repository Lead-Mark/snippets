            "description": "Ah, Spain, where “vacation” apparently means nine straight days of dodging hooves and drinking wine out of leather bags while bulls do their best impression of a freight train. The annual 'Running of the Bulls' kicked off in Pamplona with thousands of thrill seekers playing a medieval game of tag with a bunch of angry, 1,000-pound animals. Locals tossed water from balconies to cool down the chaos, as if hydration is the problem here. Everyone there still convinced this is all very normal. SMH. Read for yourself.",

            "description": "Just when you thought the weather was your biggest problem in Oklahoma, someone decided to play Mission: Impossible at News 9’s radar site. A mystery man scaled a fence Sunday night, surgically murdered the power supply, smashed a generator panel, and even took out the security cameras. The vandal’s handiwork temporarily knocked out the NextGen Live radar, a tool that, you know, saves lives. Thankfully, service is back, but the police are now hunting the guy who thought Oklahoma’s weather coverage needed a blackout. SMH.",
