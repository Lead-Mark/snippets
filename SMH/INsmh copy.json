            "link": "https://www.npr.org/2025/06/06/nx-s1-5424682/air-traffic-control-overhaul",
            "description": "America’s air traffic control system is currently managed with technology older than your grandkids' first Nintendo. But don't worry, it's getting a facelift. After embarrassing outages at Newark’s airport revealed the FAA is still fumbling with floppy disks and Windows 95, the agency now claims it’ll ditch these relics in favor of... CD-ROMs. You know, tech that peaked during Clinton's first term. Industry experts are skeptical; Congress is already fighting about facility closures; and former FAA officials admit upgrades tend to stall because nobody wants to unplug the dinosaurs. Think your flights will soon run smoother on ‘90s nostalgia alone? SMH. Read for yourself.",

Included are a single toilet, a water tank, and a sewage system. Located right on the beach, this 'luxury' toilet boasts a stunning surfside view, power hookup, and exactly zero shelter. The owners originally dreamed of building something more substantial but apparently thought better of it. Because who needs walls, right? SMH.",
