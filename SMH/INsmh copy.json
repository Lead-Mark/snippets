            "description": "A 65-year-old woman decided the best way to address a teenager's “reckless” e-biking was to channel her inner vigilante and chase him down in her SUV—on a pedestrian path. Julia Kalthof told deputies she just wanted to 'speak to his parents' after he zipped by too fast, but apparently her version of a neighborhood chat involves headlights in a kid’s rearview and almost running him off the path. The teen tried flagging down help, and thankfully a witness finally cut her off. She’s now facing aggravated assault charges and a hefty “you’re not supposed to drive there” citation. The teen? Still shaken, still off his bike. Because sure, the e-bike might be fast, but not as fast as misplaced suburban fury. SMH.",
