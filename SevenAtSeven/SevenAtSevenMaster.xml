Today's chart depicts the percentage of stocks trading above their 200-day moving average, a pivotal indicator of long-term stock direction. After a robust rally at the end of 2023, marked by a surge in this percentage, we're now witnessing a significant decline. This suggests we might be entering the initial phases of a genuine pullback. But there's a hidden aspect of this chart that many traders overlook – one that could lead to missing out on the present opportunity. Find out more in today's Insight of the Day.

While the Nasdaq celebrated a fresh all-time high last Thursday, an intriguing disparity emerged: a conspicuous absence of new stocks hitting 52-week highs. Such nuances between market externals and internals often reveal a deeper narrative. In today's Insight of the Day, I'll unravel this contrast and shed light on what it means for savvy traders like us.

Intriguing insights await as we dive into today's chart, revealing the intriguing relationship between the Volatility Index (VIX) and the S&amp;P 500 since late 2022. Noticeably, the VIX has surged to a 5-month high, coinciding with April's market turbulence. Despite this, the S&amp;P 500 remains just 2.5% below its peak, with the Nasdaq faring even better. What's the story behind these dynamics? Discover the full analysis in today's Insight of the Day.

Despite yesterday's dip, the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq boast impressive year-to-date gains. Even with minor setbacks, both indexes closed down less than 1%. Analyzing the maximum pullbacks of previous years reveals the current resilience. Instead of catastrophizing, I advocate for staying on the offensive until market dynamics shift significantly. Learn more in today's Insight.

As traders, it's easy to lose sight of the fact that buying a stock means owning a slice of a business. With earnings season on the horizon, it's crucial to focus on the fundamentals. The latest chart reveals a promising trend: earnings upgrades far outweigh downgrades. This should bolster market confidence, even without rate cuts. While nothing is certain, it's premature to shift to a defensive stance. Moreover, earnings season brings its own set of opportunities. Stay tuned for more insights on navigating this dynamic landscape.

In the realm of stock returns, Domino’s Pizza has outpaced Google by a staggering margin since their IPOs. Despite Google's tech prowess, Domino's smaller initial valuation has translated into massive profits. This exemplifies why I favor trading smaller stocks for their greater profit potential. Tune in for insights on leveraging this advantage in today's market landscape.

Investors are hedging their bets on substantial rate cuts by major central banks. The Fed alone is anticipated to slash rates by 1.5% over two years, aligning with its own projections. But it's not just the Fed; England, Canada, and Europe are poised for similar or even deeper cuts. Brace for a global market uplift, not just stateside. Stay tuned for further insights on the global market trend.

So here’s a quick rundown of our favorite must-see attractions in Palm Springs as well as info about where we stayed, what we ate, and what we’re excited to check out next time. Because we definitely will be back!
Did I mention we also brought our nine-pound chihuahua with us? So most of our suggestions are dog-friendly too!
Why Vacation With Kids In Palm Springs?
We chose Palm Springs for a lot of reasons. First, our East Coast-born kids had never been to California! Of course, there are lots of options for California vacations. But we wanted to avoid the hustle of a bigger city like Los Angeles or San Francisco, and we liked the idea of introducing them to the unfamiliar desert geography.

Our Bedroom, Before
You can check out all of the before photos of our home here, but as you can see below, it was a mostly blank canvas. Well, except for the crumbling drywall, crooked blinds, and wide doorways to the adjacent kitchen – all of which we had to address. But we loved the fireplace and the wall of french doors and pretty much immediately knew it would make for an amazing bedroom (since the house was listed as having only one bedroom when we bought it!).

You don’t even have to have an existing doorbell! We recently added one to our front door and it’s one of the easiest do-it-yourself projects we’ve done in a while. 
Note: This is not a sponsored post. We paid our own money ($99!) for our doorbell. This is the exact Ring Video Doorbell we bought.
Why Add A Video Doorbell?
Video doorbells are an increasingly popular home security device, and the Ring Video Doorbell is one of the most popular models out there.

It’s a low-maintenance, tropical plant that adds tons of visual impact. It’s also a great alternative to a fiddle leaf fig. 
What Is A Tree Philodendron?
The tree philodendron (Thaumatophyllum Bipinnatifidum) is a large tropical plant native to South America, primarily Brazil. However, it isn’t even technically a philodendron anymore! In 2018 it was reclassified out of the genus Philodendron and into the genus Thaumatophyllum due to its size and DNA. However, it is still colloquially referred to as a philodendron. You may still find it listed as a Philodendron Hope or Philodendron Selloumm, but Tree Philodendron is now the preferred name.
It’s known for its distinctive split leaves and long stalks. Like all tropical plants, it enjoys warm and humid environments, and when used as an indoor plant, it will thrive in medium-to-bright areas of your home.

Here’s why we chose this easy plant for our home.
The genus monstera includes over 50 different species of plants, most known for their large “monster” leaves with distinct holes and split edges. Today we’ll talk about the most popular houseplant variety of monstera: the monstera deliciosa.
What Is A Monstera Deliciosa?
Monsteras are native to the tropical environments of Central America, especially Mexico. Their large, distinct leaves are a natural adaptation to survive in the rainforest.
