Did yesterday's market dip catch you off guard? It erased last week's gains, but from a technical standpoint, it's a typical response after hitting new all-time highs. Now, the real question is how the support from March's highs will hold up. Even if it breaks, expect some sideways movement—no need to panic. Remember, markets need to shake out the overeager traders to climb higher, and that's exactly what we're seeing. It's the perfect setup for my Stealth Trades strategy, which leverages the moves of big institutional money. In fact, this Memorial Day, I’m offering a special on my strategy for just 99 cents for a full year. Don't miss out on this opportunity to align with the big players and position for the next surge. Grab it before the weekend!

We’d never been to The Big Easy before and were impressed by how family-friendly the city is. It’s not all booze, beads, and Bourbon Street! So here’s a look at where we stayed, what we did, and what we’re excited to do next time we go back – because we will definitely go back! The four of us (well, five if you count our chihuahua!) went to NOLA for 3 nights in November of 2022. At the time, our kids were 8 and 12 years old. So unfortunately we can’t vouch for our suggestions being a good fit for toddlers or younger children. Although I’m sure ours would’ve loved the Louisiana Children’s Museum and Storyland playground back in the day!

As we navigate through the bull market, one looming question persists: How big of a problem is inflation really? Despite the alarm bells rung by bears and the media, our latest data shows a decrease in the number of S&amp;P 500 companies concerned about inflation during their earnings calls. This signals a potentially overstated issue, with corporate earnings—key market drivers—still on solid ground. If you're watching the market meander sideways and finding it "boring," you might be missing out. Sideways markets are ripe for strategic positioning, often preceding significant movements. Join me tomorrow at 10 a.m. Eastern for a masterclass where I'll delve into insider trading insights, showing you how to distinguish between high and low signal trades and uncover the top-performing insiders. Plus, I'll share an exclusive opportunity that's just come onto my radar. Don’t miss this chance to learn from the insiders—reserve your spot now!

But it turns out many of our favorite go-to houseplants do just fine in shady corners and low-light locations. So before you write off your house as too dark to sustain plant life, check out this list of the best indoor plants for low light. You might be surprised at how many good options there are! Our upstairs family room is the brightest room we’ve ever owned thanks to big unobstructed windows on all 4 sides. But most of our indoor plants live downstairs, where we get far less natural light. Luckily, that hasn’t stopped us from growing our collection of happy healthy houseplants. 9 Houseplants That Don’t Need A Lot Of Light Here are our favorite low-light indoor plants. We list a lot more info on them below, but here’s a quick list to bring on your next trip to the plant store: Snake Plant ZZ Plant Pothos Heartleaf Philodendron English Ivy Aglaonema Cast Iron Plant Monstera Parlor Palm Perhaps our favorite part of this list is that these aren’t ugly “consolation plants” that people begrudgingly buy for dark homes.

It’s a totally doable project for any homeowner. However, it can be a tedious process that can take elbow grease and patience, depending on the size of your room and the stubbornness of your wallpaper. But having removed several rooms worth of decades-old wallpaper, we can confidently say it’s worth the effort! You can also check out more before and afters of our once-wallpapered rooms.

There are dozens of different Aglaonema varieties, most with large tropical foliage and colors ranging from silvery-green, red, and even vibrant pink. They’re also tough to kill, so they’re a great option for forgetful plant owners or anyone looking for an easy win in the plant department. These truly have been very low maintenance for us. We purchased our two Aglaonemas (pronounced ag-lee-oh-neem-ah ) to put atop our daughter’s closet. It’s sometimes hard to distinguish different varieties, but we believe that’s an Aglaonema Silver (right) and either a Candy Cane or Princess Silver Queen (left).
