Because you can't C in the dark!; A recent study has shown that women who carry extra weight, tend to live longer than the men who mention it! I was so confused last night, as my printer was playing music. Turns out my paper was just jamming. Guys I need your help. In the middle of an argument with the wife she told me that I'm right… What the hell do I do next? I knew it was bad news when my friend said "you know our favorite dentist…" I had to brace myself. I don’t know if tampons are the best invention ever.. …but they’re definitely up there! My doctor ordered me to take a blood test... I got an A-. Not too bad. Can a ninja throw a star? SHUR-HE-CAN. If you were born legs first,  for a small moment you were wearing your mum as a hat! Liverpool police stopped a car &amp; were amazed to find it taxed, full MOT &amp; insured.  It wasn't stolen, there were no stolen goods or drugs. The driver was sober &amp; had a full clean licence... A police spokesman said, "We had no option but to fine him £80 for wasting police time!" Guy driving along the highway at 70mph, sees a chicken running along side keeping up. Crazy enough the chicken has three legs! Punches it to 80, chicken stays with it then cuts off down a country road. Guy follows it into the driveway of a farm, sees the farmer. "Did you see a three legged chicken speed in here"? "Yeah that's mine. I breed them that way because me, my wife, and my son all like drumsticks" the farm tells the driver. "Wow that's amazing how do they taste?" the guy asks. "Dunno" said the farmer "never caught one before".

He filed a lawsuit about the constant celebrations given to Christians and Jews while atheists had no holiday to celebrate. The case was brought before a judge. After listening to the long, passionate presentation by the atheist's lawyer, the judge banged his gavel and declared, "Case dismissed!"The lawyer immediately stood and objected to the ruling. "Your honor, how can you possibly dismiss this case? The Christians have Christmas, Easter, and many other observances. Jews have Passover, Yom Kippur, and Hanukkah. Yet, my client and all other atheists have no such holiday!"The judge leaned forward in his chair and simply said, "Obviously, your client is too confused to know about, much less celebrate, his own atheist holiday!" The lawyer pompously said, "Your honor, we are unaware of any such holiday for atheists. Just when might that holiday be?" The judge replied, "Well, it comes every year on exactly the same date. Psalm 14:1 states, 'The fool says in his heart, there is no God.' Thus, if your client says there is no God then, according to the Bible, he is a fool. April Fool's Day is his holiday. Now, get out of my courtroom!"-

But we recently had a project that was *perfectly* suited for it and, well, solid stain quickly won us over. It was recommended by a professional house painter to us, specifically because he thought it would be great for our outdoor shower. And we found it easy to apply, it gave us great coverage, and we got an even-better-than-we-expected result (which is always the best kind!). So here’s a post that covers all the pros &amp; cons and hows &amp; whys of solid stain. 
As you can see, the “canvas” for this staining project was our outdoor shower. We gave it a mini-makeover right after moving in, but we knew it may need more attention and care down the line. Honestly, we dreaded the task of stripping and restaining it – so many nooks &amp; crannies!

The plant is native to Asia, but is incredibly popular in the Southeastern United States and areas of California. In warm environments like these, star jasmine is also super easy to care for and grow. Just another reason we love it!
Star jasmine can grow as a dense ground cover, but we prefer to use it as a climbing vine. This does require a trellis, pergola, stakes, or some other structure for it to grow up. Those are easy to make and we have DIY tutorials for a wire trellis on a wall as well as a freestanding privacy trellis.
