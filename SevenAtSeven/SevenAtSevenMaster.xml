			<link>https://stocksurgedaily.com/why-most-traders-are-clueless/</link>
			<description>Hey, it's Ross Givens here with the Chart of the Day. While the Nasdaq celebrated a fresh all-time high last Thursday, an intriguing disparity emerged: a conspicuous absence of new stocks hitting 52-week highs. Such nuances between market externals and internals often reveal a deeper narrative. In today's Insight of the Day, I'll unravel this contrast and shed light on what it means for savvy traders like us.

			<description>Hey, it's Ross Givens here with the Chart of the Day. Intriguing insights await as we dive into today's chart, revealing the intriguing relationship between the Volatility Index (VIX) and the S&amp;P 500 since late 2022. Noticeably, the VIX has surged to a 5-month high, coinciding with April's market turbulence. Despite this, the S&amp;P 500 remains just 2.5% below its peak, with the Nasdaq faring even better. What's the story behind these dynamics? Discover the full analysis in today's Insight of the Day.

			<description>Hey, it's Ross Givens here with the Chart of the Day. Despite yesterday's dip, the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq boast impressive year-to-date gains. Even with minor setbacks, both indexes closed down less than 1%. Analyzing the maximum pullbacks of previous years reveals the current resilience. Instead of catastrophizing, I advocate for staying on the offensive until market dynamics shift significantly. Learn more in today's Insight.

			<link>https://stocksurgedaily.com/is-the-bull-market-over/</link>
			<description>Hey, it's Ross Givens here with the Chart of the Day. As traders, it's easy to lose sight of the fact that buying a stock means owning a slice of a business. With earnings season on the horizon, it's crucial to focus on the fundamentals. The latest chart reveals a promising trend: earnings upgrades far outweigh downgrades. This should bolster market confidence, even without rate cuts. While nothing is certain, it's premature to shift to a defensive stance. Moreover, earnings season brings its own set of opportunities. Stay tuned for more insights on navigating this dynamic landscape.

			<description>Hey, it's Ross Givens here with the Chart of the Day. In the realm of stock returns, Domino’s Pizza has outpaced Google by a staggering margin since their IPOs.

			<description>Hey, it's Ross Givens here with the Chart of the Day. Investors are hedging their bets on substantial rate cuts by major central banks. The Fed alone is anticipated to slash rates by 1.5% over two years, aligning with its own projections. But it's not just the Fed; England, Canada, and Europe are poised for similar or even deeper cuts. Brace for a global market uplift, not just stateside. Stay tuned for further insights on the global market trend.

			<description>My fiancé and I wanted to get married at the public library. But they told us it was all booked up! I hate it when people get simple sayings wrong. I mean it's not rocket surgery! My son picked his nose and wiped it on me. He said it was funny. I told him it was snot. I tried to order some tennis balls online but the site keeps crashing…  I guess the server must be down! My wife told our son not to play with electricity. Now he’s grounded.

			<description>Why is "dark" spelled with a "k" and not a "c"? Because you can't C in the dark!; A recent study has shown that women who carry extra weight, tend to live longer than the men who mention it! I was so confused last night, as my printer was playing music. Turns out my paper was just jamming. Guys I need your help. In the middle of an argument with the wife she told me that I'm right… What the hell do I do next? I knew it was bad news when my friend said "you know our favorite dentist…" I had to brace myself. I don’t know if tampons are the best invention ever.. …but they’re definitely up there! My doctor ordered me to take a blood test... I got an A-. Not too bad. Can a ninja throw a star? SHUR-HE-CAN. If you were born legs first,  for a small moment you were wearing your mum as a hat! Liverpool police stopped a car &amp; were amazed to find it taxed, full MOT &amp; insured.  It wasn't stolen, there were no stolen goods or drugs. The driver was sober &amp; had a full clean licence... A police spokesman said, "We had no option but to fine him £80 for wasting police time!" Guy driving along the highway at 70mph, sees a chicken running along side keeping up. Crazy enough the chicken has three legs! Punches it to 80, chicken stays with it then cuts off down a country road. Guy follows it into the driveway of a farm, sees the farmer. "Did you see a three legged chicken speed in here"? "Yeah that's mine. I breed them that way because me, my wife, and my son all like drumsticks" the farm tells the driver. "Wow that's amazing how do they taste?" the guy asks. "Dunno" said the farmer "never caught one before".

			<description>If you find these jokes funny, something is probably wrong with you! I was digging in the garden and happened to find a chest with a lot of gold coins. I wanted to run home to tell my wife about it. Then I remembered why I was digging in the garden. What's yellow and can't swim? A bus full of children. The doctor gave me one month to live, so I shot him with my gun. The judge gave me 15 years. What do you call a dog with no legs? It doesn't matter what you call him, anyway he won't come. Cremation is my final hope for a smoking-hot body. What's the last thing in a fly's head as it hits the windshield of a car going 100 mph? It's behind. What's worse than biting an apple and then discovering a worm? Biting the apple, then discovering half a worm. When ordering dinner at a restaurant, I asked the waiter how they prepared their chicken. He explained. "We just tell them they're going to die." An apple a day keeps the doctor away only if you throw it hard enough. Why can't orphans play baseball? They don't know where their home is. Welcome back to Plastic Surgery Anonymous. It's nice to see new faces here today! Why can't you have a book on how to commit suicide in a library? Because you wouldn't return it back. What makes sad people jump? Bridges. I don't have any carbon footprint. I drive everywhere. I wished to die, but then I got a job. Now I want to pass out. What do you call a bacterial disease that is caused by two grizzlies? Twobearculosis. My doctor told me to stop eating red meat,  so now I dye it orange. Why are overweight babysitters an awful idea? The babies always get crushed when they sit on them. How do you stop a baby from choking? Let go of his neck. When I see the lovers' names written on a tree, I don't find it romantic or cute. I find it weird how people would take knives on their dates. I was shocked when I found out my toaster was not waterproof. A dark joke is like food, which many people don't get. If you think I am joking about Alzheimer's, forget it. Where did Lucy go during the bombing? Everywhere. It's important to have a perfect vocabulary. If I had known to distinguish between anecdote and antidote, one of my good friends would still be alive. You're not useless. You can always be used as a bad example. I have jokes about unemployed people, but sadly, none work. What did the frog say at his puppeteer's funeral? Not a word.

			<title>A Weekend In Palm Springs With Kids</title>
			<link>https://www.younghouselove.com/palm-springs-with-kids/</link>
			<description>Palm Springs, California may not scream “kid-friendly destination” but we recently had THE BEST vacation there with our family (our kids are 9 and 13). So here’s a quick rundown of our favorite must-see attractions in Palm Springs as well as info about where we stayed, what we ate, and what we’re excited to check out next time. Because we definitely will be back!
Did I mention we also brought our nine-pound chihuahua with us? So most of our suggestions are dog-friendly too!
Why Vacation With Kids In Palm Springs?
We chose Palm Springs for a lot of reasons. First, our East Coast-born kids had never been to California! Of course, there are lots of options for California vacations. But we wanted to avoid the hustle of a bigger city like Los Angeles or San Francisco, and we liked the idea of introducing them to the unfamiliar desert geography.

			<title>6 Ways We Upgraded Our Bedroom</title>
			<link>https://www.younghouselove.com/beachy-bedroom-before-and-after/</link>
			<description>Our bedroom used to be a living room, so it’s taken some work to turn it into a comfortable, functional, and beautiful sleeping space (it’s truly one of our favorite rooms!). So today we’re outlining the 6 most impactful improvements we made to our bedroom, complete with some updated pictures.

Our Bedroom, Before
You can check out all of the before photos of our home here, but as you can see below, it was a mostly blank canvas. Well, except for the crumbling drywall, crooked blinds, and wide doorways to the adjacent kitchen – all of which we had to address. But we loved the fireplace and the wall of french doors and pretty much immediately knew it would make for an amazing bedroom (since the house was listed as having only one bedroom when we bought it!).

			<link>https://www.younghouselove.com/how-to-install-a-ring-video-doorbell/</link>
			<description>Did you know you can add a Ring Video Doorbell without an electrician or having to fuss with any wires? You don’t even have to have an existing doorbell! We recently added one to our front door and it’s one of the easiest do-it-yourself projects we’ve done in a while. 
Note: This is not a sponsored post. We paid our own money ($99!) for our doorbell. This is the exact Ring Video Doorbell we bought.
Why Add A Video Doorbell?
Video doorbells are an increasingly popular home security device, and the Ring Video Doorbell is one of the most popular models out there. With it, we can see and hear what’s going on at our front door from anywhere using the Ring smartphone app. We can even speak through it if we’re not home to a neighbor who stops by or to a delivery person with a package!

			<title>Tree Philodendron – Care Guide</title>
			<link>https://www.younghouselove.com/tree-philodendron-care-guide/</link>
			<description>The tree philodendron, which was formerly known as the hope philodendron or philodendron selloum, is one of our FAVORITE houseplants. It’s a low-maintenance, tropical plant that adds tons of visual impact. It’s also a great alternative to a fiddle leaf fig. 
What Is A Tree Philodendron?
The tree philodendron (Thaumatophyllum Bipinnatifidum) is a large tropical plant native to South America, primarily Brazil. However, it isn’t even technically a philodendron anymore! In 2018 it was reclassified out of the genus Philodendron and into the genus Thaumatophyllum due to its size and DNA. However, it is still colloquially referred to as a philodendron. You may still find it listed as a Philodendron Hope or Philodendron Selloumm, but Tree Philodendron is now the preferred name.
It’s known for its distinctive split leaves and long stalks. Like all tropical plants, it enjoys warm and humid environments, and when used as an indoor plant, it will thrive in medium-to-bright areas of your home.

			<title>Monstera Deliciosa – Plant Care Guide</title>
			<link>https://www.younghouselove.com/monstera-deliciosa-plant-care-guide/</link>
			<description>Monsteras are one of the most iconic indoor houseplants today and for good reason. They’re an eye-catching, low-maintenance tropical plant that looks great in any space. Our monsteras are still low and bushy, but they’re climbing plants that can grow tall &amp; tree-like too. Here’s why we chose this easy plant for our home.
The genus monstera includes over 50 different species of plants, most known for their large “monster” leaves with distinct holes and split edges. Today we’ll talk about the most popular houseplant variety of monstera: the monstera deliciosa.
What Is A Monstera Deliciosa?
Monsteras are native to the tropical environments of Central America, especially Mexico. Their large, distinct leaves are a natural adaptation to survive in the rainforest. The splits and holes in its leaves (called “fenestrations”) allow the plant to grow larger without getting too heavy, while also allowing sunlight and rain to reach lower parts of the plant.
