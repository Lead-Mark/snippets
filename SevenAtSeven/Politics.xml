            <description>The National Guard troops stationed in Washington, D.C., will remain deployed in the district through at least February 2026, CNN reported. The troops' orders had been expected to lapse at the end of November, but were recently extended by Secretary of War Pete Hegseth. There are 2,387 National Guard troops in D.C., with the mission costing $1 million daily, according to CNN. The troops were initially deployed to D.C. to help reduce crime, but have also been involved in beautification efforts. Several troops have expressed frustration at having to leave behind higher paying civilian jobs to station in D.C., CNN revealed. Crime has dropped during the surge, according to figures from the White House and the local police department, but data also showed crime was falling in the lead-up to the federal takeover.</description>
