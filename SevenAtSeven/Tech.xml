            <description>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently said that the company is doing “well more” than $13 billion in annual revenue — and he sounded a little testy when pressed on how it will pay for its massive spending commitments. His comments came up during a joint interview on the Bg2 podcast between Altman and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella about the partnership between their companies. Host Brad Gerstner (who’s also founder and CEO of Altimeter Capital) brought up reports that OPenAI is currently bringing in around $13 billion in revenue — a sizable amount, but one that’s dwarfed by more than $1 trillion in spending commitments for computing infrastructure that OpenAI has made for the next decade.</description>
