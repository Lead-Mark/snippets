            <description>Teri Hatcher isn't desperate to go under the knife anytime soon. In her appearance on the Oct. 27 episode of The Skinny Confidential podcast, the Desperate Housewives star, 60, shared her honest outlook on aging and plastic surgery. She explained: "When I look in the mirror and I think [about] what is lacking, what am I still struggling with, what would I like to be better at...how can I find peace...my answer is not a facelift. My answer to myself is internal work, it's intellectual work, it's emotional work."</description>
