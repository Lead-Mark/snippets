So here’s a quick rundown of our favorite must-see attractions in Palm Springs as well as info about where we stayed, what we ate, and what we’re excited to check out next time. Because we definitely will be back!
Did I mention we also brought our nine-pound chihuahua with us? So most of our suggestions are dog-friendly too!
Why Vacation With Kids In Palm Springs?
We chose Palm Springs for a lot of reasons. First, our East Coast-born kids had never been to California! Of course, there are lots of options for California vacations. But we wanted to avoid the hustle of a bigger city like Los Angeles or San Francisco, and we liked the idea of introducing them to the unfamiliar desert geography.

Our Bedroom, Before
You can check out all of the before photos of our home here, but as you can see below, it was a mostly blank canvas. Well, except for the crumbling drywall, crooked blinds, and wide doorways to the adjacent kitchen – all of which we had to address. But we loved the fireplace and the wall of french doors and pretty much immediately knew it would make for an amazing bedroom (since the house was listed as having only one bedroom when we bought it!).

You don’t even have to have an existing doorbell! We recently added one to our front door and it’s one of the easiest do-it-yourself projects we’ve done in a while. 
Note: This is not a sponsored post. We paid our own money ($99!) for our doorbell. This is the exact Ring Video Doorbell we bought.
Why Add A Video Doorbell?
Video doorbells are an increasingly popular home security device, and the Ring Video Doorbell is one of the most popular models out there. With it, we can see and hear what’s going on at our front door from anywhere using the Ring smartphone app. We can even speak through it if we’re not home to a neighbor who stops by or to a delivery person with a package!
