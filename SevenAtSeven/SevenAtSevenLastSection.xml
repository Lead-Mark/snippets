But I ended up there this summer on a dad-and-daughter trip I took with some family members: and WOW, we loved it. It was a surprising and wonderful departure from our usual family trips, so I wanted to share some highlights in case anyone else is interested in breaking out of the more typical beach or theme park vacation routine. Growing up on the East Coast and now living in Florida, I haven’t spent much time in the upper Midwest. So these sights may be old hat for some of you. But just like our trip to the California desert earlier this year, this was a chance for us to soak up some new-to-us geography. Why We Vacationed In South Dakota South Dakota is home to lots of epic vistas, charming towns, and outdoor adventures.

We love traditional names (aka: old-fashioned names, aka classic names) and both of our children are named after our grandparents – one on John’s side and one on my side. So I had fun putting together this list of my favorite 100 classic boy names. They feel established, like they stand the test of time, and can carry special meaning if they’re already names in your family. ALSO IS THERE ANYTHING CUTER THAN BABY SUSPENDERS?!? One interesting thing I found when I was writing this post was that many of the top ten most popular names for boys in 2024 are arguably pretty classic: #1: Liam #2: Noah #3: Oliver #4: James #5: Elijah #6: Mateo #7: Theodore #8: Henry #9: Lucas #10: William But beyond that short list of the most popular boy names this year, there are so many other classic boy names to choose from.

The four of us (well, five if you count our chihuahua!) went to NOLA for 3 nights in November of 2022. At the time, our kids were 8 and 12 years old.
