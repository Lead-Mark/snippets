But it turns out many of our favorite go-to houseplants do just fine in shady corners and low-light locations. So before you write off your house as too dark to sustain plant life, check out this list of the best indoor plants for low light. You might be surprised at how many good options there are!

But most of our indoor plants live downstairs, where we get far less natural light. Luckily, that hasn‚Äôt stopped us from growing our collection of happy healthy houseplants. 9 Houseplants That Don‚Äôt Need A Lot Of Light Here are our favorite low-light indoor plants. We list a lot more info on them below, but here‚Äôs a quick list to bring on your next trip to the plant store: Snake Plant ZZ Plant Pothos Heartleaf Philodendron English Ivy Aglaonema Cast Iron Plant Monstera Parlor Palm Perhaps our favorite part of this list is that these aren‚Äôt ugly ‚Äúconsolation plants‚Äù that people begrudgingly buy for dark homes.

As we traveled from room to room removing wallpaper, we tested 4 different methods, and today we‚Äôll share what we learned. Removing wallpaper doesn‚Äôt require special tools or lots of money. It‚Äôs a totally doable project for any homeowner. However, it can be a tedious process that can take elbow grease and patience, depending on the size of your room and the stubbornness of your wallpaper. But having removed several rooms worth of decades-old wallpaper, we can confidently say it‚Äôs worth the effort! You can also check out more before and afters of our once-wallpapered rooms.
