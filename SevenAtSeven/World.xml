            <description>King Charles was heckled by a protester who asked whether he had “asked the police to cover up” for his scandal-ridden brother, as pressure mounts on the monarchy to take further action against Prince Andrew. During a visit to Litchfield Cathedral today, a man in the crowd asked the king a string of questions, including: “How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?” In a video, believed to have been filmed by the protester as he spoke, the man goes on to ask Charles twice: “Have you asked the police to cover up for Andrew?”</description>
