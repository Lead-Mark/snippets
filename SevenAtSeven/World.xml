            <description>Israeli warplanes struck Gaza on Tuesday night, shortly after Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, ordered the military to carry out “powerful strikes” in Gaza, in the latest test of the increasingly shaky US-brokered ceasefire. Witnesses reported seeing Israeli planes launch strikes on Gaza City, as well as explosions across the strip shortly after Netanyahu’s announcement. At least two people were killed and four wounded in a strike on a residential building in Gaza City, and an area close to al-Shifa hospital was also struck.</description>
