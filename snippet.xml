    <SsevIntro>This Saturday's edition of Seven at 7 It brings you a dual exploration of disappointment and devastation. From the underwhelming clash of titans in "Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire" to the dark unraveling of America's opioid crisis by a once-revered physician, join us as we delve into stories of cinematic flops and real-life tragedies.</SsevIntro>
    <SsevCon>"There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you." - Maya Angelou</SsevCon>
    <SsevStoryI>While The Titans Flash, Fans Cringe...</SsevStoryI>
    <SsevMoreStoryI>Amidst the ruins of what could have been a cinematic spectacle, "Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire" emerges as a titanic clash that disappoints more than it dazzles. Following the Oscar-winning "Godzilla Minus One," this sequel hoped to ride the waves of its predecessor's success. However, with underwhelming effects that starkly contrast the visual storytelling of yesteryears and a narrative that feels as light as the digital pixels it's made of, this monster mash-up falls notably short. The giants of cinema, Godzilla and Kong, seem to move through a world without weight, their battles lacking the impact and awe of their storied pasts. Despite the introduction of new kaiju dynamics and a dive into the hollow Earth's mysteries, the film struggles to capture the essence that once made these characters legendary. Could this signify a turning point for the future of monster cinema, where visual grandeur no longer compensates for a lack of soulful storytelling?</SsevMoreStoryI>

    <SsevStoryII>A Prescription for Tragedy: The True Story of the Architect of America's Opioid Crisis</SsevStoryII>
    <SsevMoreStoryII>In the quiet shadows of Southern Ohio, a storm was brewing, one that would sweep across the nation leaving a trail of devastation in its wake. At the heart of this storm was Dr. Paul Walman, a name that has since become synonymous with one of the country's most egregious breaches of medical trust. Dispensing millions of opioid pills, Walman orchestrated what the DEA dubbed the largest pill mill operation, earning him four life sentences for the overdose deaths of four patients. Yet, beneath the surface of these harrowing statistics lies a complex tale of a once-respected physician turned infamous drug dealer. "Prescription for Pain," a book meticulously researched over nearly 15 years by journalist Philip Isle, sheds light on the depth of Walman's descent into infamy. But as the opioid crisis continues to grip the nation, one must ask: How much of this tragedy could have been prevented, and what does it reveal about the systemic failures at play?</SsevMoreStoryII>

    <TLCStoryI>Will This Win Over Any Of Nikki Haley's Voters?</TLCStoryI>
    <TLCMoreStoryI>In a tactical maneuver designed to widen the political rift within the Republican base, President Joe Biden's latest campaign ad directly targets Nikki Haley's erstwhile supporters, showcasing disparaging remarks made by Donald Trump. Leveraging Trump's own statements, the ad presents a clear message: Trump doesn't want or need Haley voters. With significant polling data suggesting a potential shift of Haley supporters toward Biden, especially in battleground states, this strategy could redefine the electoral landscape come November. But will this bold play successfully attract those disillusioned with Trump, or will it further entrench partisan divides? How will conservatives navigate this attempt to fragment their ranks?</TLCMoreStoryI>

    <SMHStoryI>Our Brains Change Over Our Lifetimes</SMHStoryI>
    <SMHMoreStoryI>Did you know that your brain, the command center for your entire being, begins its intricate developmental journey just two weeks after conception and continues its complex processes even after you've taken your last breath? This fascinating voyage from the neural plate folding in the womb to the mysterious cognitive bursts in the moments after death is nothing short of miraculous. Along the way, your brain undergoes transformations that shape your learning abilities, emotional responses, and even your perception of the world around you. As we peel back the layers of the brain's life cycle, from the rapid neuron growth in infancy to the synaptic pruning in adolescence, and the profound adaptability in old age, one has to wonder: what incredible secrets does the brain hold in those final moments, and how does it continue to function minutes after the heart stops?</SMHMoreStoryI>

    <SMHStoryII>What's Life Like In Louisiana’s Cancer Alley, One Of The Most Polluted Areas In America?</SMHStoryII>
    <SMHMoreStoryII>Nestled along an 85-mile stretch of the Mississippi River lies a region with a name as ominous as its reality: Cancer Alley. Here, amidst the dense clustering of chemical plants and refineries, the majority-Black communities have been bearing the brunt of industrial advancement gone awry. Decades of unchecked emissions have not only marred the air, water, and soil but have also deeply scarred the lives of its inhabitants. From rampant cancer cases to heartbreaking rates of miscarriages, the tales of suffering are both profound and pervasive. How did this area, once rich with the potential for agricultural bounty, transform into a hotspot for environmental injustice and health crises? And what does the steadfast resilience of Cancer Alley's residents reveal about the broader battle for environmental equity and justice in America?</SMHMoreStoryII>

    <SMHStoryIII>Man Arrested For Eerie Act Of Cannibalism On California Street</SMHStoryIII>
    <SMHMoreStoryIII>In an incident that seems ripped straight from a horror movie, Kern County, California, became the backdrop for an unimaginably gruesome act. Following a tragic collision at an Amtrak station in Wasco, where an individual lost their life—and a leg—27-year-old Resendo Tellez allegedly took the severed limb and began to eat it while walking down the street. Witnesses, shocked and horrified, captured the act on video, showing Tellez handling and allegedly consuming the leg with a chilling nonchalance. This macabre spectacle has not only sent shockwaves through the local community but also poses haunting questions about the intersection of mental health, homelessness, and societal safety nets. How does a society begin to understand, let alone address, such a deeply unsettling event?</SMHMoreStoryIII>
