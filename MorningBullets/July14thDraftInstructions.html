      <h2 style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 0;">🔥 The Big Bullet</h2>
      <p><strong>What happened:</strong> In a narrow 51–50 vote, the Senate passed Trump’s “Big, Beautiful” Megabill. It features permanent middle-class tax cuts, $600B in defense boosts, and Medicaid reform—adding $3.3T to deficits over ten years. Republicans championed it as a pro-growth package, while Democrats warned of budgetary risk. → <a href="#" style="color: #0056b3; text-decoration: none;">[The Hill]</a>, <a href="#" style="color: #0056b3; text-decoration: none;">[Washington Times]</a></p>
      <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Markets initially cheered: defense, energy, and industrial stocks spiked. But Powell’s caution and yield spikes—up over 4.5%—have begun pushing back. Moody’s warned of a possible credit-rating downgrade if fiscal discipline doesn’t follow, adding pressure particularly on long-duration tech equities. → <a href="#" style="color: #0056b3; text-decoration: none;">[Fox Business]</a>, <a href="#" style="color: #0056b3; text-decoration: none;">[WSJ]</a>, <a href="#" style="color: #0056b3; text-decoration: none;">[Washington Examiner]</a></p>
      <p><strong>What’s next:</strong> The House takes up the bill—watch for growing GOP dissent. Treasury auctions and yield moves will signal market confidence (or concern). Look to transport, defense, and consumer cyclicals for early opportunity.</p>
