"In this league where goals are a premium and how all we've done is make the rules for more goal scoring, that's what we've done."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Every year there seems to be something we tweak so more goals can be scored, and that's great. But, there's mandates and the words were to pull a goal off the board it has be unbelievably egregious. That's the standard to pull a goal off the board ... I couldn't find anything remotely egregious," the coach explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Net front battles aren't allowed anymore? The boxing out rules there are like prison rules in the playoffs, but it's not prison rules for the goalies? We might as well put skirts on them then if that's how it's going to be. I mean they have to battle through stuff too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;div&gt;"We might has well put skirts on them then... I think we're letting the goalies off the hook."\n\nLightning coach Jon Cooper weighs in with his perspective on the two disallowed goals tonight and the impact those decisions had on the game.&lt;/div&gt; ‚Äî  (@)        &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BallyLightning/status/1785138353869816244"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The throw-away comment did not fall on deaf ears, however, as vapid claims of sexism soon followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Put skirts on them? Wow, that's some kind of misogyny. Coach, you should be better. Gross," one fan &lt;a href="https://x.com/jessmfla/status/1785144024573108726" target="_blank"&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ian Kennedy, writer for the Hockey News, called Cooper's comments "&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/IanKennedyCK/status/1785157897875300445" target="_blank"&gt;open sexism&lt;/a&gt;" that "just can‚Äôt be part of a head coach‚Äôs vernacular."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a couple days later, Cooper opened a &lt;a href="https://x.com/Diandra_loux/status/1785701332470366713" target="_blank"&gt;press conference&lt;/a&gt; by apologizing for the remarks, and shockingly said the negative responses he received felt even worse than the playoff loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a "massive supporter" of women's hockey, Cooper said, "Quite frankly, it was wrong, and I've got to go explain myself to my [daughters]."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anyway, I sincerely apologize to all I offended, it's pained me more than the actual series loss itself," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;div&gt;Jon Cooper opens his presser addressing the \u201cgirls in skirts\u201d comment from Monday night. \n\nHe says this has been harder than the loss. #GoBolts&lt;/div&gt; ‚Äî  (@)        &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Diandra_loux/status/1785701332470366713"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Respect that Jon Cooper opened by addressing this.

cut the ribbon of a new film studio in Shreveport, Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As someone who has always believed in the transformative power of music, film, and television, I'm beyond excited to introduce the expansion of my G-Unit Film &amp; Television through the launch of G-Unit Studios right here in Shreveport," Jackson said in comments to &lt;a

been acting, producing, and creating music videos for nearly two decades now, acting as executive producer for the first time in 2010 for film "&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1449379/" target="_blank"&gt;Caught in the Crossfire&lt;/a&gt;." He then produced another movie that same year called "&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1560954/" target="_blank"&gt;Gun&lt;/a&gt;," starring himself and Val Kilmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;G-Unit Film &amp; Television is already credited with a documentary called "50 Cent: The New Breed" and the production of the aforementioned "Power."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From the gritty narratives of the streets to the compelling stories that define our era, G-Unit has always been more than just entertainment; it's a platform for voices that need to be heard, stories that need to be told," he said, referring his rap group G-Unit, which is now his production house name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson also explained that the idea of bringing the film studio to Shreveport wasn't simply a business decision, but a targeted commitment to "fostering talent, creating opportunities, and building a community that thrives through creativity and innovation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We see Shreveport as a beacon of inspiration and creativity," he said about the city. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shreveport has a population of just under 200,000 and is about a three-hour drive from Dallas, Texas, and four hours from Baton Rouge, Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;div&gt;You know the vibes Shreveport is gonna be booming \ud83d\udca5this summer \u2022 https://t.co/IH2wzn8Xov&lt;/div&gt; ‚Äî  (@)        &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/50cent/status/1785281519122026758"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shreveport Mayor Tom Arceneaux said that he and the city are excited to have the new studio in their back yard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This city's rich culture and talent provides the perfect backdrop for this endeavor. We are eager to collaborate with Mr. Jackson and G-Unit Film &amp; Television to bring captivating movies and entertainment to Shreveport and Caddo Parish."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;50 Cent's footprint has become wider and wider, especially with his charity work with the &lt;a href="https://gunityfoundation.org/g-story/" target="_blank"&gt;G-Unity Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. Charity work has seen Jackson travel to places like Houston, Texas; Somalia; and his hometown of Queens, New York, where he hands out Thanksgiving turkeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team building and entrepreneurship are skills I learned along the way, but they are so important to develop early. I look forward to G-Unity supporting programs that are doing the crucial work of teaching kids to excel at life," Jackson said on the website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like Blaze News?
