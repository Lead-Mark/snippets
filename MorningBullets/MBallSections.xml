Gary Knight said to reporters at a media briefing on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unclear what made him want to go through the home, killing the children," he continued. "But make no mistake about it, what happened in that residence was nothing short of a massacre. Those children were hunted down and killed.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators said Jonathon Candy shot 18-year-old Dylan Candy, 14-year-old Ethan Candy, and 11-year-old Lucas Candy, then turned the gun on himself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knight said they were trying to figure out why the father killed three of his sons but allowed one son to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI know that‚Äôs a question everybody has,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a question we have, too. In the end, nobody ever is going to have an answer for that.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators have also been so far unable to discover a motive for the massacre, and they may not ever be able to piece it together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have no calls to that residence regarding any type of domestic abuse," said Knight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neighbors and friends of the Candy family are equally stunned and horrified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúAll day, we just couldn‚Äôt imagine,‚Äù Michael Burcham told the Oklahoman newspaper. ‚ÄúHe must have really been having a hard time.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burcham said that Jonathon Candy had previously confided in him that he had suffered from depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the horrifying massacre, Jonathon and Lindsay Candy had been interviewed by a news station and spoke glowingly about a local bakery and deli shop. With Lindsay at his side, Jonathon recommended the breakfast burritos and carrot cake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Oklahoma City Thunder basketball team confirmed that Jonathan Candy had worked for them as a part-time game-night engineer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surviving child was placed with his relatives.

He fled on foot and allegedly ran into Tinnin's home at about 9:30 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI jumped over this couch, and we met there by the front door," the grandmom told KRQE-TV. "That‚Äôs when he grabbed me and was upset and said to give him my keys. He said he didn‚Äôt want to go to jail. He did threaten to hurt my granddaughter and me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tinnin gave him her key fob and tried to calm him down. She said that she called 911 and kept the line open while the rest of the events transpired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As we were walking, ... I put my hands on him ... to try to be calming," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tell me what your name is, ... tell me where you are from."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Get back! I will f****** shoot you!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man took the key fob and left but returned to ask for more keys. She took her granddaughter to a bedroom and grabbed her gun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI told him to not hurt us, that I would do whatever he wanted. I would give him keys, money, whatever it took,‚Äù she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tinnin said she comforted her granddaughter and then returned outside of the bedroom to find that Rivera had not left. That's when she threatened to shoot him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúGet back. Get back! I have a gun. Get back! Get back. I will f****** shoot you!" she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that point, one gunshot can be heard on the recording.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why did you shoot me?‚Äù the suspect can be heard asking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúBecause you‚Äôre in my f****** house!‚Äù she responds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the threat, Tinnin put pressure on the man's wound to stop the bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that point, video surveillance captures scores of police officers swarming the home and dragging the suspect out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tinnin says she wants Rivera to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and called on the district attorney to refuse a plea deal. The man has had five previous felony convictions and faces numerous charges stemming from the home invasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Megan Tinnin Austin says that her daughter is traumatized from the events of that night and is afraid of the dark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tinnin says that she believes God was looking over her and her granddaughter that evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI do believe we had a guardian angel here with us, and I do firmly believe that God was watching over us,‚Äù she concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Here's the stunning video report:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="rm-shortcode" style="display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like Blaze News?

The report found that they were infected despite not having any other HIV risk factors and determined that the operations were to blame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vampire facials involve blood being drawn from the client's arm and platelets being removed from the blood and injected into the patients with microneedles. The process is intended to rejuvenate the skin and clear away acne and wrinkles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC report said as many as 59 clients could have been exposed to HIV through the facials and Botox injections at a business in Albuquerque that was unlicensed and didn't use appropriate safety measures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the report did not name the clinic, KRQE-TV reported that VIP Spa owner Maria Ramos de Ruiz pleaded guilty to several felony counts of practicing without a license in 2022 and was sentenced to serve three and a half years in prison. The New Mexico Department of Health also shut down her spa in 2018 after finding unlabeled blood tubes on a kitchen counter and injectables stored in a kitchen refrigerator next to food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;De Ruiz is currently incarcerated at Springer Correctional Center. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the three HIV positive cases, two other infections were linked to the clinic through "direct or indirect connection with services provided at the VIP Spa," said a department spokesperson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new case of HIV infection linked to the clinic &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/hiv-cases-linked-new-mexico-salon-vampire-facials-rcna93054" target="_blank"&gt;prompted&lt;/a&gt; the department to tell past clients to be tested for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C, even if they had previously tested negative. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It‚Äôs very important that we spread the word and remind people who received any kind of injection related to services provided at the VIP Spa to come in for free and confidential testing," said Dr. Laura Parajon, the deputy secretary of the health department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC warns people against seeking treatments and operations at unlicensed spa facilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Here's a news report about the report: &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="rm-shortcode" style="display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like Blaze News?
