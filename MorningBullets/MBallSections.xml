Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) not surprisingly appears to be fully backing the Hamas-loving, Israel-hating demonstrations that have been springing up with greater frequency on college campuses in the last couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an X post Tuesday night, Ocasio-Cortez condemned calling police on what she deemed "nonviolent demonstrations of young students."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;         ‚Äî  (@)        &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1782943713053790629"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Calling in police enforcement on nonviolent demonstrations of young students on campus is an escalatory, reckless, and dangerous act," she &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1782943713053790629" target="_blank"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;. "It represents a heinous failure of leadership that puts people‚Äôs lives at risk. I condemn it in the strongest possible terms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surely, AOC realizes not all the protesters are "nonviolent," right? To wit:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Students &lt;a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/cal-poly-university-closes-after-apparently-violent-pro-hamas-activists-barricade-themselves-inside-campus-hall" target="_blank"&gt;took over a building&lt;/a&gt; at California State Polytechnic University in Humboldt, forcing the school to &lt;a href="https://krcrtv.com/north-coast-news/eureka-local-news/protestors-barricade-inside-cal-poly-humboldts-siemens-hall-arrests-made" target="_blank"&gt;close temporarily&lt;/a&gt; as a safety precaution. Andy Ngo reported that the occupiers turned to "beat[ing] and assault[ing]" cops who were trying to remove them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StopAntisemites/status/1782056834922078558" target="_blank"&gt;male pro-Palestinian protester&lt;/a&gt; stabbed a female Jewish student in the eye amid Yale University &lt;a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/i-was-stabbed-in-the-eye-at-yale" target="_blank"&gt;demonstrations&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://columbiabarnardhillel.org/staff/elie-buechler/" target="_blank"&gt;Rabbi Elie Buechler&lt;/a&gt; of the Columbia University/Barnard College Hillel on Sunday &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/columbia-jewish-students-warned-rabbi-over-their-safety-1892613" target="_blank"&gt;told Jewish students&lt;/a&gt; that police "cannot guarantee [their] safety in the face of extreme antisemitism and anarchy." Buechler also advised Jewish students to "return home as soon as possible and remain home until the reality in and around campus has dramatically improved. It is not our job as Jews to ensure our own safety on campus.‚Äù The school soon switched to remote-option learning for safety reasons for the rest of the semester.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some Columbia protesters reportedly were cited for resisting arrest and assaulting a police officer. Not that it matters ‚Äî as AOC would be glad to know ‚Äî since none of the 228 Columbia and NYU demonstrators &lt;a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/pro-hamas-protesters-arrested-for-taking-over-new-york-universities-won-t-face-criminal-records-report" target="_blank"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; received charges that will go on their records.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of those responding to Ocasio-Cortez saw right through her rhetoric, too. Some prominent examples:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Conservative commentator Jason Rantz &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonrantz/status/1783011937070305634" target="_blank"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; AOC, "Something tells me if people illegally camped on your property ‚Äî while supporting terrorists (whomever you think are terrorists since you don‚Äôt feel that way about Hamas) ‚Äî you‚Äôd call the cops. Sorry that your fellow Jew-haters don‚Äôt get to break the law."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;International human rights lawyer Arsen Ostrovsky &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Ostrov_A/status/1782975746719289360" target="_blank"&gt;added&lt;/a&gt; to the congresswoman, "They are explicitly inciting violence, engaging in racial hatred and impeding students and faculty for learning and teaching. The only ‚Äòheinous failure in leadership‚Äô is your justification of this behavior."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Journalist Kyle Becker &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kylenabecker/status/1783113171625984276" target="_blank"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; to AOC that "radical Marxists don't have a right to disrupt entire communities to throw their temper tantrums."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like Blaze News?

Of those 300, 142 allegedly cut through a temporary fence constructed of concertina wire, an act that "constitutes an illegal entry into the U.S.," according to a &lt;a href="https://kfoxtv.com/news/local/el-paso-texas-tx-judge-drops-state-charges-for-140-migrants-accused-of-rioting-concertina-wire-public-defender-kelli-childress-diaz-jennifer-vandenbosch" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from Border Patrol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then allegedly engaged in some kind of "encounter" with law enforcement agents with Gov. Greg Abbott's Operation Lone Star, the &lt;a href="https://www.elpasotimes.com/story/news/immigration/2024/04/22/el-paso-county-judge-no-probable-cause-of-border-riot-arrests-judge-ruben-morales/73418221007/" target="_blank"&gt;El Paso Times&lt;/a&gt; reported, though the nature of that "encounter" is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All 142 individuals, most of whom are &lt;a href="https://elpasomatters.org/2024/04/23/el-paso-da-bill-hicks-migrant-riot-indictments-border-wall/" target="_blank"&gt;believed to be&lt;/a&gt; Venezuelan nationals, currently face federal charges of illegal entry into the U.S. However, when local prosecutors also wanted to charge them with riot participation for the alleged confrontation with law enforcement, El Paso County Judge Ruben Morales expressed doubt about the underlying predicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After reviewing the affidavit, I don't believe that [probable cause] exists," Morales said at a hearing on Monday. "I don't believe there is probable cause for these individuals to continue to be detained for the offense of riot participation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morales ultimately dismissed 140 of the riot-related cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="rm-shortcode" style="display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morales' ruling was not legally binding, however, and on Tuesday, just one day after Morales' dismissal, El Paso District Attorney Bill Hicks proceeded with the indictments anyway, having first impaneled a grand jury that supported the indictments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we took the broader case to the grand jury, we presented the case as a whole, we presented videotape evidence of what happened. The grand jurors believed that there was, in fact, probable cause," Hicks said at a &lt;a href="https://elpasomatters.org/2024/04/23/el-paso-da-bill-hicks-migrant-riot-indictments-border-wall/" target="_blank"&gt;press conference&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all, Hicks has charged 141 people with riot participation. They include all 140 cases dismissed by Judge Morales as well as an individual with an additional charge of criminal mischief. None of their names have been released. All have reportedly been transferred from the county jail into ICE's custody as part of their immigration detainer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Texas, riot participation is a Class B misdemeanor that carries a maximum penalty of 180 days in jail or a $2,000 fine, so impaneling a grand jury for such a case was unusual. But Hicks, a Republican, believes that adjudicating these cases is important for public safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People believe they can come to our country knocking down barriers, endangering lives, causing our national guardsmen to fear for their lives," &lt;a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/da-bill-hicks-indicts-migrants-for-rioting-after-judge-ruled-there-was-no-probable-cause/ar-AA1nxRYe" target="_blank"&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt;. "... They cannot do that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="rm-shortcode" style="display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El Paso County Public Defender Kelli Childress, who represents the defendants, views these cases very differently. She called the indictments "horrific" and indicated they were largely baseless. "They have no witnesses. They have no evidence," she said. Prosecutors are simply charging them as "part of [a] group," she claimed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hicks countered that individuals should be held accountable for participating in a group that then collectively commits a crime: "If you‚Äôre a part of the group that is committing a criminal act, you know that you‚Äôre part of that group, you know that the group has committed a criminal act, then you are guilty of the offense of riot."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hicks noted that he intends to offer the defendants a plea deal that will include time served. Thus far, none have reportedly accepted it. Following their hearings for the state charges, Hicks said, "They‚Äôd be released to Border Patrol, and either some people will be deported, or some people are going to get released."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like Blaze News?
