I mean, we don‚Äôt have a football team to begin with, if you get me," said Garcia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martinez went on to offer another reason students didn't care to protest against Israel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the relative lack of interest in the Study Abroad program is a factor. Study Abroad is an important program because it fosters an understanding of global events and attitudes. Many students here at CSUB just see it as a luxury they don‚Äôt have the time or money for,‚Äù he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the campus continued to stay relatively peaceful, after this report aired, a larger number of pro-Hamas &lt;a href="https://www.kget.com/news/local-news/campus-protests-over-israel-hamas-war-come-to-bakersfields-cal-state-campus/" target="_blank"&gt;protesters showed&lt;/a&gt; up at the university. Officials said the protesters organized the one-hour rally with them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CSU system said in a statement that it did not intend to change its investments in relation to the Israeli-Hamas conflict. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bakersfield is a city of about 400,000 residents in the San Joaquin Valley about 113 miles north of Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Here's more about CSU Bakersfield:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="rm-shortcode" style="display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like Blaze News?

The measure would require the exclusion of noncitizens from the figures used in determining each state's number of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. The number of House seats in a state also impacts how much influence that state will have on the outcome of presidential elections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2024193" target="_blank"&gt;vote&lt;/a&gt; was 206-202, strictly along party lines, with Republicans supporting passage and Democrats voting against the measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unanimous Democrat opposition to requiring citizenship for apportionment of House seats and Presidential electoral college votes says it all," Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1788429941081555229" target="_blank"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;.

I don‚Äôt.

She said she intended to rob him and not participate in oral sex. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police said that when Hayes and the man got to the park, she shot and killed him in order to take his $60. She reportedly told police she was "thirsty for money" and used the money to buy two hot wing combo meals for herself and her boyfriend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite admitting that the woman on the video was her daughter, she says that she doesn't believe she pulled the trigger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police however, charged Hayes with first-degree murder in perpetration of a robbery. Judge Ronald Lucchesi  &lt;a href="https://wreg.com/news/local/woman-accused-of-killing-man-for-60-appears-in-court/" target="_blank"&gt;told Hayes&lt;/a&gt; Thursday in court that she could face the death penalty or life in prison if she's convicted for the crime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones had a warning for young people who were at risk of getting in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Think about what you're doing," she said. "They need to be a leader, not a follower, and watch who they hang around with."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hayes said she had $13 leftover after buying the combos, prompting many on social media to comment on inflation hitting chicken wing prices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://wreg.com/news/local/shelby-county-memphis-murder-rate-increased-50-in-2023-crime-commission-says/" target="_blank"&gt;recent report&lt;/a&gt; found that the murder rate in Memphis and the surrounding had soared by 50% in 2023 from the previous year, and crime rates across the board had increased from 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Here's a local news report about the incident:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="rm-shortcode" style="display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like Blaze News?
