Investigators believe that the 23-year-old model was gunned down because of her previous relationship with a married drug lord. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shocking surveillance video shows the moment that a beauty pageant contestant was murdered inside a restaurant in Quevedo, &lt;a href="https://www.theblaze.com/tag/equador" target="_blank"&gt;Ecuador&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CCTV footage shows Landy P√°rraga Goyburo eating a meal at a restaurant with a man on Sunday afternoon. Suddenly, a masked assailant burst through the front door to shoot and kill the model. A second gunman secures the front door. After the beauty model was shot three times, both men are seen fleeing the &lt;a href="https://www.theblaze.com/tag/crime" target="_blank"&gt;crime scene&lt;/a&gt;. Goyburo is left in a pool of her own blood before dying. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities suspect that the lethal hit job was ordered by the spouse of a drug lord, whom Goyburo was rumored to have a fling with. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, Goyburo was reportedly mentioned in a text message conversation between now-deceased drug trafficker Leandro Norero and his accountant ‚Äì Helive Angulo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If my wife comes across anything about her, I‚Äôm screwed," Norero allegedly &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/04/29/world-news/moment-beauty-queen-is-gunned-down-after-being-linked-to-ecuadorian-gang-boss/" target="_blank"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; to his attorney in 2022. "My friend, her name cannot come out anywhere. Otherwise, my world will come crashing down."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Attorney General‚Äôs Office was reportedly investigating Goyburo's finances, but she was never charged with any crime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norero would later be arrested and then killed in prison just six months into his incarceration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goyburo has not publicly commented on Norero or his purported criminal organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecuadorian investigators believe that a food pic shared on &lt;a href="https://www.theblaze.com/tag/instagram" target="_blank"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; tipped off the alleged cartel hitmen on Goyburo's location. Goyburo ‚Äì who has more than 175,000 followers on her &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/landyparraga.ec/" target="_blank"&gt;Instagram page&lt;/a&gt; ‚Äì posted a photo of octopus ceviche to her social media account. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goyburo had been in Quevedo to attend a wedding last Saturday, according to &lt;a href="https://www.ecuavisa.com/noticias/seguridad/landy-parraga-excandidata-miss-ecuador-asesinada-quevedo-FD7243025" target="_blank"&gt;Ecuavisa&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goyburo competed in the 2022 Miss Ecuador beauty contest, where she represented the Los Rios province. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her final Instagram post made on Wednesday, P√°rraga wrote: "The world is an echo, what you send into it, you get out of it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;WARNING: Graphic video&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="rm-shortcode" style="display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;        Cartel-Linked Beauty Queen SHOT Dead in Ecuador                        &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBBOm0k-dZE" target="_blank"&gt;www.youtube.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like Blaze News?

A federal judge warned that the married mother of three poses a "danger to the community."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/i-sound-like-a-pervert-high-school-teacher-accused-of-having-sexual-relationship-with-mentally-ill-16-year-old" target="_blank"&gt;Blaze News previously reported&lt;/a&gt;, Sandy Carazas-Pinez was accused last year of engaging in multiple sexual acts in her car with a 16-year-old boy. The New York City public teacher was fired from her job. Carazas-Pinez, 34, had been a biology teacher at the Biondi School in Yonkers, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biondi is run by the nonprofit organization Rising Ground and assists students with special needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Biondi Middle and High School provides educational and therapeutic support to both residential and day students who have behavioral and emotional challenges, learning disabilities, or intellectual/developmental disabilities," the Rising Ground &lt;a href="https://www.risingground.org/biondimiddlehigh/" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carazas-Pinez was arrested in July after allegedly sending nude images and sexually explicit text messages to a 16-year-old student. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I do miss your touch and kisses not going to lie. I also miss seeing you masturbate, I sound like a pervert," she purportedly wrote to the boy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mother of the alleged victim discovered the illicit content and reported the teacher to local authorities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mother said, "It‚Äôs the rape of a child with a mental illness. As a society, we have to prioritize the safety of children who are mentally ill and boys who are sexually assaulted."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The minor reportedly suffers from schizophrenia and a mood disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carazas-Pinez allegedly committed multiple violations after being arrested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, Carazas-Pinez allegedly violated her bail conditions. She was instructed not to have any unsupervised contact with any child under the age of 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The married mother of three reportedly emailed another former student a day after he turned 18 to wish him a happy birthday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/04/us-news/ny-teacher-charged-with-sex-abuse-of-mentally-ill-student-jailed/" target="_blank"&gt;New York Post&lt;/a&gt; reported that Brooklyn federal judge John Cronan revoked the bail of Carazas-Pinez after she allegedly breached her bail conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cronan noted that the infraction was technically not a violation, but "it seems to fly in the face of the spirit of the conditions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cronan said Carazas-Pinez poses ‚Äúa real danger to the community.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even her own lawyer called the ex-teacher's behavior "troubling." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said the former teacher‚Äôs conduct shows a "pattern of grooming" a student for sex. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mother of the alleged victim told The Post, "She‚Äôs a very disturbed individual, and I‚Äôm glad she no longer has access to children ‚Äî especially mine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like Blaze News?

Four bodies have been discovered in a well, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theblaze.com/tag/mexico" target="_self"&gt;authorities in Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. Three suspects are in custody in relation to the disappearance of the surfers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Baja California Attorney General‚Äôs Office confirmed on Friday that four bodies were found in a well near a surfing spot known as La Bocana, about 130 miles south of San Diego, California. It took rescuers 20 hours to pull the bodies out of the well that was said to be 50 feet deep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citing a source within the attorney general's office, &lt;a href="https://fox5sandiego.com/news/local-news/fourth-body-found-in-well-where-three-missing-surfers-located/?ipid=promo-link-block1" target="_blank"&gt;KUSI-TV&lt;/a&gt; reported that three of the bodies were the missing surfers. The news outlet reported that the fourth body was a ranch owner who was reported missing two weeks ago. The rancher purportedly owned the property where the bodies were located. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://zetatijuana.com/2024/05/arrestan-a-tres-por-desaparicion-surfistas-extranjeros-en-ensenada/" target="_blank"&gt;Zeta Tijuana&lt;/a&gt; reported that police officers located the surfers' camping area, where there were "blood and dental parts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities believe the surfers were killed in a robbery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWhen they tried to get the vehicle, the victims opposed the robbery, the robbers were armed with a firearm and apparently shot the victims,‚Äù Baja California State Attorney-General Maria Elena Andrade Ramirez told &lt;a href="https://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/incidents/shot-australian-brothers-killed-in-robbery-according-to-authorities/news-story/7f2ff57d256878afe8ddf3fd236c9272" target="_blank"&gt;7News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shell casings were reportedly found at the campsite where the trio was last seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The missing surfers who are presumably dead are a San Diego man named 30-year-old Jack Carter Rhoad and Australian brothers 30-year-old Jake Robinson and 33-year-old Callum Robinson, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/border-baja-california/story/2024-05-02/search-missing-surfers-ensenada-robinson-rhoad" target="_blank"&gt;San Diego Union-Tribune&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. and Australian citizens went missing earlier this week during a surfing trip south of Ensenada, Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Family members last heard from men last Saturday. However, they did not notify authorities until a few days later when the surfers didn't show up at an Airbnb near K38 ‚Äì a popular Baja surfing spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, a white Chevrolet Colorado pickup truck belonging to the San Diego man was located and had been set on fire. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three suspects were arrested on Wednesday in two different police operations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/04/us-news/three-suspects-arrested-in-disappearance-of-three-surfers-in-mexico/" target="_blank"&gt;New York Post&lt;/a&gt; reported that police arrested Jes√∫s Gerardo Garica Cota, alias El Kekas, and his partner Ari Gisel Garc√≠a Cota. Also taken into custody was Cristian Alejandro Garc√≠a ‚Äì the brother of Kekas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cota ‚Äì a 23-year-old Mexican woman ‚Äì allegedly had a surfer's cell phone in her possession at the time of the arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three of the suspects were in possession of an assortment of methamphetamines and other illegal drugs at the time of their arrest, according to Baja California's chief public prosecutor Maria Elena Andrade Ramirez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Baja California Attorney's Office &lt;a href="https://www.fgebc.gob.mx/boletines/10929-fge-en-coordinacion-con-fbi-trabajan-para-localizar-a-ciudadanos-extranjeros-desaparecidos" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Mexican authorities were in close communication with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Consulate, and the Australian Consulate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baja California is known as one of Mexico's most violent, cartel-controlled states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Callum Robinson shared photos from the trio's surfing vacation on his &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17990422016637680/?hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;Instagram account&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robinson was an accomplished lacrosse player known as "The Big Koala."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stevenson University paid tribute to the former student-athlete and alumni.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our prayers and thoughts are now for Callum's parents, Martin and Debra Robinson, who lost their two sons; the family of their friend Jack Carter Rhoad; and the many loved ones and friends all of these young men had," the university said in a &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/baltimore/news/stevenson-mourns-loss-of-alumni-callum-robinson/" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday morning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He was a stellar student, a stellar athlete, and an even better friend.

Mizell was rushed to the nearby Jacobi Medical Center, but she succumbed to her injuries soon after. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The superintendent of the building where Emery was found outside bleeding to death identified the suspect as a resident of the building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[The attacker] came out of the building, and the other girl came from outside," superintendent Armando De La Cruz told the &lt;a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/05/03/teen-girl-15-charged-in-fatal-stabbing-of-17-year-old-emery-mizell-in-the-bronx/" target="_blank"&gt;New York Daily News&lt;/a&gt;. "They started fighting, and one of them pulled a knife and stabbed the other."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was reportedly a group of about 10 minors around when the fatal stabbing happened. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A neighbor told the news outlet, "I thought they were playing. They were just kids. Then people were running back and forth getting tissues to stop the bleeding."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to her grieving father, Mizell attended James Monroe High School and was set to graduate in June. Emery was looking forward to attending her senior prom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suspect reportedly attended the same high school as Mizell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tony Mizell told the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/03/us-news/girl-charged-with-murder-in-fatal-nyc-stabbing-of-emery-mizell-over-social-media-feud-sources/" target="_blank"&gt;New York Post&lt;/a&gt;, "She was a beautiful child, just a beautiful child."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to police, Emery and her alleged killer were involved in an ongoing feud on social media. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a police insider who spoke to the New York Post, the victim had faced relentless harassment on social media prior to the tragic slaying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Latanya Mizell, Emery‚Äôs second cousin, said, "They shouldn‚Äôt be fighting because somebody said this about that person. It‚Äôs stupid stuff. It‚Äôs not worth taking somebody‚Äôs life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added, "These are kids, both of them. They both lost their lives. That right there is hurtful enough as a whole because we got to be better with our kids."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We‚Äôve got some difficulty in our schools. But we have seen a very significant uptick in violence right outside the school, around the corner and up the block," David C. Banks ‚Äì the New York City schools chancellor ‚Äì &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/nyregion/teenager-stabbing-murder-bronx.html" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; during a town hall meeting in Manhattan on Thursday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mizell's 13-year-old sister Gianna told the New York Post, "She was there for me when no one was there all the time. She gave me advice all the time when I needed it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don‚Äôt know how I feel right now. I have mixed emotions right now. At one point, I‚Äôm crying. The next minute I‚Äôm like, I don‚Äôt know. Every time I go through my camera I see her," the heartbroken Gianna said of her slain sister. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emery has two other siblings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She was good. Strong. I miss her so much. I want to tell her that, 'I love you, please be safe, and I love you so much,'" said 6-year-old Josiah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She was a good girl. I love her. I want her to come back," said 9-year-old Josiah. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like Blaze News?

But I cannot and will not take responsibility or apologise to anyone who‚Äôs made up stuff about me or exaggerated stories about me."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI‚Äôve never told someone that if they give me sexual favours, then I will help them out with their career, ever."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI‚Äôve clearly hooked up with, you know, some men who thought they might get ahead in their careers by having a relationship with me. But there was no conversation with me, it was all part of their plan, one that was always destined to fail, because I wasn‚Äôt in on the deal.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And he said: ‚ÄúWere there times when I would flirt with some of the people who were involved in those programmes who were in their 20s? Yes. Did I ever hook up with another actor? Yes. Did I make a clumsy pass at someone who wasn‚Äôt interested as it turned out? Yes.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThat may not have been the best decision and it‚Äôs not one that I would do today. But it happened. It wasn‚Äôt illegal, and nor has it ever been alleged to have been illegal," he continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spacey &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KevinSpacey/status/1786080999526322465" target="_blank"&gt;took to X&lt;/a&gt;, writing: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Over the last week, I have repeatedly requested that @Channel4 afford me more than 7 days to respond to allegations made against me dating back 48 years and provide me with sufficient details to investigate these matters.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Channel 4 has refused on the basis that they feel that asking for a response in 7 days to new, anonymized and non-specific allegations is a ‚Äúfair opportunity‚Äù for me to refute any allegations made against me. I will not sit back and be attacked by a dying network's one-sided ‚Äúdocumentary‚Äù about me in their desperate attempt for ratings. There's a proper channel to handle allegations against me and it‚Äôs not Channel 4. Each time I have been given the time and a proper forum to defend myself, the allegations have failed under scrutiny and I have been exonerated.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blaze News &lt;a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/actor-kevin-spacey-acquitted-of-all-charges-in-sexual-assault-trial-i-ve-lost-everything" target="_blank"&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt; on Spacey's case in 2023. Four individuals came forward, claiming that Spacey had sexually assaulted them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report read:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;All four alleged victims testified during the trial, and three of them alleged that Spacey had either grabbed their genitals without consent or forced them to touch his. However, the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/26/uk/kevin-spacey-trial-jury-verdict-intl/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;fourth&lt;/a&gt; accuser made an even more serious allegation. He claimed that he had once sought Spacey's advice regarding his burgeoning acting career. Two weeks later, Spacey invited the man over to his apartment, where Spacey then drugged the man and sexually assaulted him, he testified. After falling asleep or losing consciousness, the man said he woke up to find Spacey performing a sex act on him.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite winning the case, Spacey says that he has nothing left. He went on to mention that he still has legal bills to pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like Blaze News?
