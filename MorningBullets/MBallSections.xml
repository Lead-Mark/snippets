[is] 100% from the standpoint of ‘let us sit back and enjoy the dumpster fire that is happening in front of us,”’ she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, she dives into the latest iteration, featuring Rwandan-Scottish actor Ncuti Gatwa as the Doctor. Gatwa is celebrated as “the first Black and first openly queer man to take on the role,” according to an &lt;a href="https://ew.com/doctor-who-ncuti-gatwa-cover-story-8633590" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Entertainment Weekly article&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What even is sci-fi without the black queers?” mocks Lauren, pointing out Disney’s incessant woke diversity propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's crazy because for four years, now, the reviews and the ratings for ‘Doctor Who’ have been falling and falling,” and yet, “for the first time ever, the BBC is partnering with Disney+ to launch the show worldwide. And when the new season premieres May 10, it will air simultaneously around the globe,” says Lauren, citing the article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The piece also reported that the show would have “a bigger budget” and “a bigger platform.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that wasn’t enough to turn you off, “the creative team behind ‘Doctor Who’ are just total ideologues,” says Lauren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to screenwriter and producer Russell T. Davies, “[He] searched the galaxy, auditioning men, women, and nonbinary actors from all sorts of diverse backgrounds” to find the perfect actor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Lauren is certain this isn’t true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re not looking for white men — especially not white, straight men,” she says, adding that Hollywood’s version of diversity means “anyone who is not white, straight, and male.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, Gatwa reported that he and his onscreen partner, Millie Gibson, interact “like two girls in school giggling and gossiping.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Is that really the dynamic we want to see from our ‘Doctor Who’ sci-fi show?” asks Lauren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But somehow, it gets even worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gatwa, who’s expressed his affinity for wearing skirts, may just get to continue donning his favorite clothing item during filming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It seems like they are going to make skirt-wearing part of this new Doctor's identity,” says Lauren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the article, “[Gatwa] quickly befriended costume designer Pam Downe, and together they dreamed up an entire TARDIS closet for the Doctor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She laid out her sketches on the table, and I saw kilts and skirts and all kinds of gender-pushing, societal-pushing outfits, and I was like, ‘Yes, let’s do &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;all of them&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;,”’ he said in the interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But skirts aren’t enough for the actor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also said: “I need a big dance number! That’s what I’m going to put into the universe: I need the Doctor to have a big, fierce dance routine that, like, destroys a monster with twerking. Or maybe some death drops, and that’s what will drop the monster.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Are you excited for your black, gay, cross-dressing 'Doctor Who'?” Lauren asks sarcastically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To hear more of her analysis, watch the clip below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="rm-shortcode" style="display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Want more from Lauren Chen?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To enjoy more of Lauren’s pro-liberty, pro-logic, and pro-market commentary on social and political issues, &lt;a href="https://get.blazetv.com/packages/?utm_source=theblaze&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article_shortcode_laurenchen" target="_blank"&gt;subscribe to BlazeTV&lt;/a&gt; — the largest multi-platform network of voices who love America, defend the Constitution, and live the American dream.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2024 22:41:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Surging GOP Senate candidate unleashes on 'both parties' during border visit: 'Failing the American people'</title><link>https://www.foxnews.com/politics/surging-gop-senate-candidate-unleashes-both-parties-during-border-visit-failing-american-people</link><description>Former Maryland Gov.

It appears  its contents are similarly provocative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a course syllabus and corresponding documents &lt;a href="https://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/srhe_course_guide.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;obtained&lt;/a&gt; by the Washington Free Beacon, students will learn about&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;how Western societies and the medical profession are supposedly racist; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;how morbid obesity "came to be pathologized and medicalized in racialized terms";&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the apparent &lt;a href="https://www.sinsinvalid.org/blog/disability-justice-a-working-draft-by-patty-berne" target="_blank"&gt;connection&lt;/a&gt; between "ableism" and "heteropatriarchy, white supremacy, colonialism and capitalism";&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the supposed positives of sex-change mutilation;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the apparent value in abolishing prisons;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"how race and class contributes to a patient's ability to access and receive gender-affirming care"; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the "role of healthcare workers within community organizing and protest."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Flier, the former dean of Harvard Medical School, told the &lt;a href="https://freebeacon.com/campus/pedagogical-malpractice-inside-ucla-medical-schools-mandatory-health-equity-class/" target="_blank"&gt;Beacon&lt;/a&gt; the mandatory course "promotes extensive and dangerous misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The university "has centered this required course on a socialist/Marxist ideology that is totally inappropriate," continued Flier. "As a longstanding medical educator, I found this course truly shocking."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slides from the first session make clear that the aim is to transform future doctors into progressive activists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A section entitled "Our Hxstories" reportedly adds that "[h]ealth and medical practice are deeply impacted by racism and other intersectional structures of power, hierarchy, and oppression — all of which require humility, space and patience to understand, deconstruct, and eventually rectify."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another reading provides potential doctors with a list of demands to echo, including calls for a cancellation of Third World debt; state-controlled agricultural policies responding "to people's needs and not to the demands of the market"; state control and taxation of speculative international capital flows; gender, equity, and environmental impact assessments for all economic polices; and an end to "growth-centered economic theories."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Ben Shapiro &lt;a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/ben-shapiro-reveals-how-ucla-med-students-are-taught-anti-white-anti-american-hatred" target="_blank"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; that students in the course "are told to read about wars of 'Indigenous resistance' — in which Native Americans killed thousands of white people — to 'imagine what liberation could look like.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;South African billionaire Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1763760016245375005" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; of the course documents, "This is messed up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students at the medical school whose DEI czar was just &lt;a href="https://www.theblaze.com/ucla-school-of-medicines-radical-dei-czar-clumsily-plagiarized-vast-portions-of-her-dissertation-on-dei" target="_self"&gt;outed as a likely plagiarist&lt;/a&gt; are also given a &lt;a href="https://pipewrenchmag.com/dismantling-medical-fatphobia/" target="_blank"&gt;heavy reading&lt;/a&gt; from the self-described "fat liberationist" Marquisele Mercedes that claims that "weight loss is a useless, hopeless endeavor" and that the "relationship between weight and health is also muddy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mercedes, a grad student based in New York City, intimates in her quasi-autobiographical rant that an aversion to morbid obesity — a term she partially censors — is rooted in racism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is a profoundly misguided view of obesity, a complex medical disorder with major adverse health consequences for all racial and ethnic groups," said Flier. "Promotion of these ignorant ideas to medical students without counterbalancing input from medical experts in the area is nothing less than pedagogical malpractice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former Harvard Medical School dean stressed that whoever signed off on the curriculum was unfit to make such decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are areas where medicine and public health intersect with politics, and these require discussion and debate of conflicting viewpoints," Flier told the Beacon. "That is distinct from education designed to ideologically indoctrinate physician-activists."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nationally syndicated radio host and co-founder of Blaze Media Glenn Beck recently highlighted how the medical profession watchdog Do No Harm has revealed "23 of America's top 25 medical schools now have anti-racism instruction as the &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;core&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; part of their curriculum."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="rm-shortcode" style="display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/gQs6rQxW5JE" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like Blaze News?
