We tend to mistrust and stereotype outsiders. Acknowledging this can relieve tension and lead to honest, productive conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spike Lee has spent his career sparking such conversations, nowhere more effectively than in his 1989 film &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/do-right-thing-review-movie-1989-1220930/" target="_blank"&gt;‚ÄúDo the Right Thing.‚Äù&lt;/a&gt; Depicting the simmering racial tension of one hot summer day in Brooklyn, Lee's film at first seems to side mainly with its black characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it progresses, however, Lee makes sure we also see the complicated humanity of their white antagonists. They, like everyone else in the film, are just trying to get by and live their lives. They have more important things to worry about than race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/gLYTObRhcSY?si=Dm69_qGMS1DIRl7E" target="_blank"&gt;One scene&lt;/a&gt; in particular captures Lee's ‚Äúwe're-all-in-this-together‚Äù approach: different characters ‚Äì the black protagonist (played by Lee himself), a Korean grocer, a white cop, a Puerto Rican neighbor ‚Äì address the camera with rapid-fire racial slurs. The creativity and fluency with which each character denigrates another race makes it funny; the genuine anger behind it makes it uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="rm-shortcode" style="display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the tension finally explodes in violence and destruction (which can't help but remind us of the summer of 2020, if not our current campus unrest), ‚ÄúDo the Right Thing‚Äù again chooses to unsettle. Nobody has proven a point; nobody has ‚Äúwon.‚Äù The characters, like the audience, are left to ponder the seemingly insurmountable human impulse to scapegoat and turn strangers into enemies.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Biden brings up Islamophobia amid the worst antisemitism outbreak in decades</title><link>https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-brings-up-islamophobia-amid-worst-antisemitism-outbreak-decades</link><description>President Biden, while condemning anti-Israel violence at college campuses across the country, brought up Islamophobia despite the worst antisemitism outbreak in decades.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 10:00:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Private Farms Disappearing, Food Crisis Could Ensue</title><link>https://pjmedia.com/catherinesalgado/2024/05/02/private-farms-disappearing-food-crisis-could-ensue-n4928728</link><description>The post Private Farms Disappearing, Food Crisis Could Ensue appeared first on üîî The Liberty Daily.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 11:52:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Leftist Election Interference Crew</title><link>https://www.realclearpolitics.com/2024/05/03/the_leftist_election_interference_crew_622921.html</link><description></description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 11:49:40 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Harvard Commencement Speaker Published Editorial Likening Israel to Hitler</title><link>https://www.conservativereview.com/harvard-commencement-speaker-published-editorial-likening-israel-to-hitler-2668140500.html</link><image_url>https://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-munich-security-conference-scaled-e1714671632222.jpg</image_url><description>&lt;img src="https://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-munich-security-conference-scaled-e1714671632222.jpg" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harvard's commencement speaker, media CEO Maria Ressa, published an editorial that compared Israel after Hamas's October 7 terrorist attack to Nazi Germany and accused the Jewish state of "targeting" news reporters in an "unprecedented attack on journalist safety."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://freebeacon.com/campus/harvard-commencement-speaker-published-editorial-likening-israel-to-hitler/"&gt;Harvard Commencement Speaker Published Editorial Likening Israel to Hitler&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://freebeacon.com"&gt;Washington Free Beacon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 10:00:12 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>VP Stakes: Trump meeting with potential running mates this weekend</title><link>https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-huddling-potential-running-mates-top-republican-donors</link><description>Donald Trump moves from the courtroom in New York City to the banquet rooms in South Florida on Friday, as he headlines a gathering of top Republican donors and teams up with potential running mates.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 09:08:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Karl Marx Weekend Special: Fight Against Rising Marxism With Personal Preparedness</title><link>https://thelibertydaily.com/karl-marx-weekend-special-fight-against-rising-marxism/</link><description>The Liberty Daily benefits when you buy from their sponsors.

Yet today's electorate views the instability that Trump brought to Washington differently than the disorder that Biden unleashed at home and abroad. Once there was a single "chaos president."
