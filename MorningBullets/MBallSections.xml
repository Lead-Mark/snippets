Bombholing is the practice of publishing wild and unsubstantiated stories in the press, then sending those same stories down the memory hole when they turn out to be false. Then the media hits viewers with a new "bombshell," which makes people forget the old "bombshell." Viewers are led "from mania to mania."</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 22:26:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>9 deaths in mass overdose incident in Austin involving dozens: 'One of the worst we've seen'</title><link>https://www.conservativereview.com/9-deaths-in-mass-overdose-incident-in-austin-involving-dozens-one-of-the-worst-we-ve-seen-2668156822.html</link><image_url>https://www.theblaze.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=52171403&amp;width=1200&amp;height=600&amp;coordinates=0%2C66%2C0%2C66</image_url><description>&lt;img src="https://www.theblaze.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=52171403&amp;amp;width=1200&amp;amp;height=600&amp;amp;coordinates=0%2C66%2C0%2C66" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[rebelmouse-proxy-image https://www.theblaze.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=52171403&amp;amp;width=1200&amp;amp;height=800&amp;amp;coordinates=151,0,151,0 crop_info="%7B%22image%22%3A%20%22https%3A//www.theblaze.com/media-library/image.jpg%3Fid%3D52171403%26width%3D1200%26height%3D800%26coordinates%3D151%2C0%2C151%2C0%22%7D" expand=1]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Austin law enforcement says that a &lt;a href="https://www.kxan.com/news/local/austin/multiple-hand-to-hand-transactions-arrest-warrant-provides-more-details-in-austin-overdose-surge/" target="_blank"&gt;mass overdose incident&lt;/a&gt; is to blame for nine deaths and nearly 80 suspected overdoses over the last week in downtown Austin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Austin Police Department said that officers and the Austin-Travis County EMS began to respond to numerous reports of overdoses on Monday. The wave subsided after several days but ended up taking the lives of nine people and leading to dozens overdosing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement officials and non-profit organizations tried to battle the mass overdose incident by distributing Narcan and informing at-risk residents of the bad batch of drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emergency responders said they attended to 36 suspected overdoses on Monday and 27 on Tuesday, with 7 more on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christa Stedman, the public information officer for Austin-Travis County EMS, said in &lt;a href="https://www.kxan.com/news/overdose-surge-2-detained-after-70-overdoses-multiple-deaths-in-austin/" target="_blank"&gt;a media briefing&lt;/a&gt; that the distribution of Narcan had unquestionably saved lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've seen in just a couple of days the numbers dramatically decline, that's a great thing, and I think that speaks to the incredible work that both our community help paramedic team and our partners have done in essentially flooding the city with Narcan."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lily Hughs of the Texas Harm Reduction Alliance said that her team of volunteers had been out in the community trying to get the word out about the bad batch of drugs so that users could avoid the threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hughes said they also offered training for drug users who wanted to learn how to use Narcan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;â€œWe took extra time to do training and talk them through, and made sure every single person we talked to knew what was going on," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EMS said they had handed out about 400 doses of Narcan while the THRA said they had handed out about 100 doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Austin police later said that they had detained two persons of interest related to the overdoses. One of those suspects was identified as 55-year-old Johnny Lee Wright, who was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second person who was unidentified was arrested on a charge of possession of a controlled substance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators said they identified Wright and another person through the use of high resolution cameras that recorded Wright allegedly handing off narcotics to users after having received them from the unidentified suspect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police said that Wright and the second person were â€œknown by officers who regularly worked the downtown area as narcotics dealers." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Here's a news report about the incident:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="rm-shortcode" style="display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like Blaze News?

"Freedom was the vision of our founders, has been the goal of our men and women in uniform, and is our promise to our children.

He then went and checked the other rooms before returning and assaulting the woman, and making her perform sex acts on him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The victim's son-in-law spoke to KABC-TV about the execrable incident but wanted his face blurred to protect his identity and that of the victim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The video catches him doing things that I wouldn't wish on anyone," said the victim's relative. "There's a lot of elderly people in the community. This guy needs to be off the streets. It's probably not the first time and it won't be the last time he's done this, or will do this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that the family had set up the camera so that no one could see it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The camera in the living room is pretty hidden and we hid it from her," the son-in-law explained. "To avoid her from trying to turn it off. And he never saw that camera in the living room."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday afternoon, Los Angeles Police detectives&lt;a href="https://abc7.com/lapd-searching-for-sex-assault-suspect-in-pacoima-victim-has-dementia/14757161/" target="_blank"&gt; told KABC&lt;/a&gt; they were able to identify and arrest a suspect. They said he was still in the area near the apartment complex where the woman lived. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The son-in-law &lt;a href="https://www.foxla.com/news/81-year-old-women-with-alzheimers-sexually-assaulted-in-pacoima-home-family-says" target="_blank"&gt;told KTTV-TV&lt;/a&gt; that the woman had been diagnosed with early onset dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think itâ€™s pretty much progressed to Alzheimerâ€™s already," he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The son-in-law said they were alerted to the incident when his wife noticed her mother was up later than usual. When they rewound the recording, they were stunned by seeing the assault. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The son-in-law told KTTV that he had a suspicion about who the attacker was. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Heâ€™s known to be a lurker. He lurks around the area," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that without the recording, they would have never known what happened because the woman doesn't remember the incident due to her medical illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police said that they are investigating the incident as attempted rape. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Here's the report of the assault:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="rm-shortcode" style="display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like Blaze News?

She said they told her that they had spoken to the other girl, but it didn't help the situation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She says that when she got on the school bus to go home, the girl attacked her. Then she realized the girl's mother had also joined the fight when she called her "mom" during the fight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was scared," she said to KTVT with tears in her eyes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video shows the assault on the school bus with other students standing around recording the incident and not intervening at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I guess one of the women came and put me in a choke hold on the bus," she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She says that the women followed the bus to her stop and attacked her again. Video from the second altercation shows her being knocked to the ground and beaten. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The girl says she was able to call her mother during the attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I heard my baby scream out," said her mother to KTVT. "And no one did anything."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She's upset at the actions of the bus driver, who appeared to do nothing to prevent the fight and drove away while the girl was being attacked the second time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Had he locked the door, called for help, waited for the police to arrive. Those grown adults wouldn't have been able to get on a bus, assault my child, and they wouldn't been able to follow the bus and continue assaulting her," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The girl says she is traumatized because of the attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can't walk to the store anymore. I have to look and watch every time when I see a white car," she said. "And I have to be on watch everywhere I go. Because of you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also says that school officials suspended her for three days for her response, but she says she was simply defending herself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the Denton police told KTVT that they are taking the incident seriously and expect an update about the case soon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The victim and her mother said that they are leaning on their faith to deal with the aftermath of the violence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had to sit up at night crying about it, asking God why. But I also pray for them cause my mom taught me, just because they did you wrong, it's all for a reason. It's all for purpose," said the 13-year-old girl. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The other night when she said, 'Mom, let's pray.' And she grabbed my hand and began to pray for them, I'm like, 'Okay, you know... she's going to be all right,'" said the mother. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Here's the news report about the incident:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="rm-shortcode" style="display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like Blaze News?
