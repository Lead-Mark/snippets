Kristi Noem has defended her decision to kill a young dog many years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/apr/26/trump-kristi-noem-shot-dog-and-goat-book" target="_blank"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt; reported that in her forthcoming book, "No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward," Noem recounted the story about the dog, Cricket, that had been around 14 months old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the outlet, Noem recalled that she had taken the dog on a pheasant hunt with older canines, desiring to calm Cricket down and start to teach her how to act. But she was "out of her mind with excitement, chasing all those birds and having the time of her life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Noem stopped to speak to a family after that hunt, the dog escaped from her truck and killed the family's chickens, "grabb[ing] one chicken at a time, crunching it to death with one bite, then dropping it to attack another," Noem recounted, according to the outlet. When she grabbed the canine, Cricket "whipped around to bite me," she noted. Noem cut a check "for the price they asked, and helped them dispose of the carcasses littering the scene of the crime," she reportedly indicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I hated that dog," Noem noted, according to the Guardian, which reported that she described the dog as "untrainable," "dangerous to anyone she came in contact with," and "less than worthless ‚Ä¶ as a hunting dog."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I realised I had to put her down," Noem recalled, according to the outlet. "It was not a pleasant job," she noted, "but it had to be done."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noem's story about killing the young dog sparked significant criticism, but she has defended her decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can understand why some people are upset about a 20 year old story of Cricket, one of the working dogs at our ranch, in my upcoming book ‚Äî No Going Back," she &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KristiNoem/status/1784631108207849781" target="_blank"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. "The fact is, South Dakota law states that dogs who attack and kill livestock can be put down. Given that Cricket had shown aggressive behavior toward people by biting them, I decided what I did," she noted. "I followed the law and was being a responsible parent, dog owner, and neighbor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;         ‚Äî  (@)        &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KristiNoem/status/1784631108207849781"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like Blaze News?

The university will provide funding for two visiting at-risk Palestinian faculty members for two years and for five visiting at-risk Palestinian students for four years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the protesters were angry that the deal was struck with a small group of demonstrators that they claimed were not representative of the entire group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schill also said that the demonstrations could only include students, faculty, and staff in order to exclude outside participants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúActs of antisemitism, anti-Muslim/Arab racism, and hate will not be tolerated, and community members who can be identified participating in such acts will face disciplinary action,‚Äù he wrote in the email. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Junior Abhi Nimmagadda told WBBM that the agreement was a tremendous achievement for the anti-Israel movement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No other university, to my knowledge, has been able to secure wins this great," said Nimmagadda. "I don't believe my heart has been fuller. I'm very, very proud of everything we have been able to achieve." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But other students were reportedly angry that the university did not agree to concrete steps to end any investments that might be tied to the state of Israel. WBBM reported that they felt "blind-sided" and accused those who made the agreement of being "sellouts." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The university did agree to relaunch an advisory council to review the organization's investments and answer protesters' questions within 30 days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The private research university serves more than 23,400 students and is located in Evanston, Illinois. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Here's more about the protests:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="rm-shortcode" style="display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like Blaze News?

Benjamin Mitchell said that they were able to obtain surveillance video of a suspect with a beard, long hair, and riding a long skateboard near the cars. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They identified the man as Dunlap and arrested him on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police said a search warrant at his home ‚Äúyielded firearms, a manifesto, suicide notes, and a bag containing zip ties, masks, and gloves." A weapon described as a "medieval mace" was also found in the man's belongings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deputy Chief John Thomas &lt;a href="https://www.concordmonitor.com/Lawrence-Dunlap-plea-Concord-NH-GOP-vandalism-facebook-54928248" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that they found eight guns, including one AR-15. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He &lt;a href="https://nhjournal.com/trump-hating-realtor-with-guns-manifesto-arrested-in-gop-vandalism-incident/" target="_blank"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; made political postings online, including one in which he referred to the rioting at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 as ‚Äúdomestic terrorism." He also accused former President Donald Trump of being a dictator. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WMUR-TV &lt;a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/vandalism-cars-concord-lawrence-dunlap-42924/60640490" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; part of the manifesto obtained through the search warrant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can't continue to exist for everyone else. I truly despite humanity and all the filth we have accepted as acceptable," the manifesto read. "I'm sorry for the pain I know I will cause with this decision." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dunlap's defense attorney, Jim Rosenberg, argued that the items obtained through the search warrant were unrelated to the incidents of vandalism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a person with no significant prior criminal record, who has struggled with regard to his professional relationships work-wise recently," said Rosenberg in court. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge denied bail out of concern for the safety of the community as well as for the safety of the suspect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dunlap was charged with 11 felony counts of criminal mischief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Here's more about the arrest: &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="rm-shortcode" style="display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like Blaze News?
