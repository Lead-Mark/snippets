The rest received an F because they otherwise abscond with the foster kids' federal money in the name of "revenue maximization," oftentimes without even bothering to tell the children first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For this subset of foster youth, who face tremendous obstacles when they transition out of care, these assets can serve as a lifeline, contributing to economic stability, self-sufficiency, and successful outcomes," the study said. "Most foster youth eligible for these federal benefits will never see a dollar of their money, or even know that someone has applied for and received benefits on their behalf."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2024/04/22/michigan-foster-care-federal-benefit-money-child-welfare-costs/73355844007/?s=01" target="_blank"&gt;Detroit Free Press&lt;/a&gt; investigated the issue in Michigan, one of the 44 states to receive a failing grade in the study. According to the outlet, in fiscal year 2022-23, Michigan collected $3.2 million in federal benefits designated for foster children, all of which went toward reimbursing "the state for the cost of caring for kids in the child welfare system."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only way a Michigan foster child may begin receiving some of his or her federal benefits or have those benefits saved on the child's behalf is when "the child‚Äôs total income exceeds the cost of care," the &lt;a href="https://dhhs.michigan.gov/OLMWEB/EX/FO/Public/FOM/902-12.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Michigan Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt; indicated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, the state has apparently failed to deliver in some of those cases as well. The Free Press noted that one former foster youth whose father died did not receive federal benefits for the first six months after he was returned to the care of his birth mother, meaning the state collected nearly $5,400 to which the young man was entitled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don‚Äôt understand how they can do that to kids when they‚Äôre trying to move forward with their life," said the boy's mother, Jenny Bowden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It makes you feel like they really don‚Äôt care about it, or they‚Äôre trying to have a good image without having to do the work," Bowden's son added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked for comment, the Michigan DHHS made no attempt to deny denying foster kids their federal benefits. "This is common practice among many states," the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When a child is placed in an out-of-home situation with MDHHS, income or funds available to the child are secured and used to reimburse the public taxpayer dollars that provide payment for the child's care. If the child's total income exceeds the cost of care, the excess is saved for the child," the agency helpfully explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jill Bauer, a staff attorney at Legal Services in Washtenaw County in Michigan, took a decidedly different view. "Why should kids with Social Security have to pay for their own foster care?" she asked rhetorically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elisa Weichel, administrative director of the Child Advocacy Institute, even suggested that the state practice of taking federal money that belongs to foster children just reinforces to such children that they are viewed as possible revenue sources rather than as human beings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe that the state is choosing to put its own financial interests above the best interests of the children in its care," Weichel told the Free Press, "which unfortunately is a message these children probably also get in other ways."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like Blaze News?

The department arrested four individuals in connection with the scheme and seized 14 kilograms of fentanyl, two vehicles, and $5,261 in cash. Two of the suspected criminals, Pedro Rodriguez Correa and Maria Machuca-Alderete, were in the country illegally, according to Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd. The other two individuals, Maria Guadalupe-Garcia and Sergio Garcia, were from California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It seems like every time I come up here to talk about fentanyl with my colleagues I'm always saying, 'It's the largest fentanyl seizure in the state of Florida' and, once again, that's what I'm saying today with a seizure of 14 kilos of fentanyl," Judd stated Friday morning. "This is the single-largest seizure in the history of Polk County and that's nothing to be proud of."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the detained suspects, Guadalupe-Garcia, told deputies that she did not know anything about the narcotics and claimed to be delivering a box of diapers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When was the last time you picked up a box of Huggies that weighed 27 pounds? Maria, we don't have any Huggies in the county jail, but we will have you there," Judd said, according to WTVT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They didn't come here to better themselves and their family," he continued, referring to the two illegal migrants. "They came here to kill people in America with a deadly drug through a porous border that we need to seal off."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Judd, the amount of drugs seized in the bust is enough to kill one-third of Florida's population. He stated that the traffickers expected to be paid $42,500 for the delivery from Mexico to Florida. In total, the 14 kilogram shipment was worth $3.5 million, the office reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the sheriff's office, Rodriguez-Correa, the driver for the criminal organization, brought a six-year-old boy along for the fentanyl delivery. The Florida Department of Children and Families seized custody of the child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immigration and Customs Enforcement has placed a detainer on Machuca-Alderete and Rodriguez-Correa for being in the country illegally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Machuca-Alderete was charged with trafficking fentanyl, maintaining a vehicle to traffic illegal drugs, resisting arrest with violence, battery on an officer, unlawful use of a two-way communication device, and possession of drug paraphernalia, WTVT reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez-Correa was charged with trafficking fentanyl, unlawful use of a two-way communication device, and possession of drug paraphernalia, according to the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guadalupe-Garcia and Sergio Garcia were both charged with trafficking fentanyl, maintaining a vehicle to traffic illegal drugs, and possession of drug paraphernalia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fifth suspect, whose identity has not been released to the public, is still at large and wanted for similar charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody said during the Friday news conference, "I would submit to you that an appropriate response would not just be, 'We are going to address the cartels with hugs, not violence.' But how about how I have demanded and suggested in that we declare the cartels terrorist organizations and we designate fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Over the past year, the PCSO seized 30 additional kilograms of fentanyl - about enough to kill all the people in the state of Florida," according to the sheriff's office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like Blaze News?
