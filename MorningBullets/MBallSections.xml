Three months postpartum, my skin suddenly erupted in deep, sore, bleeding, disfiguring cystic acne that covered my entire face. My hair, once red, curly, and plentiful, turned dark and fell out in handfuls, leaving bald patches not only in the normal spots at the temple but throughout my whole scalp. My whole body seemed to swell, even six months postpartum. That following year, I had two miscarriages. Everything felt as if it were falling apart ‚Äî because it was!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If one thing unites every postpartum tradition across the world, it is female-to-female care. In case anyone needs reminding: Having a baby is a uniquely female experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This unfortunate experience inspired curiosity: What‚Äôs wrong with me? Is this normal? Was it always like this? For everyone? How could human civilization sustain itself if every child born means its mother not only endures hell through the pains of birth but also permanent, disfiguring ill health? Where‚Äôs the bliss I was promised? What am I missing? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On one hand, maternal sacrifice is built into the very fabric of reality. The built-in difficulty is a fact that must be confronted with fortitude; it also &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/14681990412331297974#:~:text=Perhaps%20after%20human%20childbirth%2C%20vasopressin,loss%20of%20interest%20in%20sex." target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;bonds us to our children&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But how much is too much? At what point does heroic fortitude become stubborn foolhardiness? At what point is it permissible to look around and wonder if the suffering you endure is the result of some easily remedied ignorance or injustice ‚Äî and so, warrants a solution? At what point is it permissible to seek help? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;At what point is it permissible to seek help?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; The fact that this question is something I regularly consider reflects how very &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;American&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; I am to the core ‚Äî proudly! That attitude is what has made America the greatest commercial republic in all of human history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ours is an implicitly industrious ‚Äî liberal, independence-prizing ‚Äî mode of operation. This doesn‚Äôt translate perfectly over to the domestic world, especially not the particular moment in time that is postpartum. It took my health crumbling completely to realize that motherhood wasn‚Äôt something I could approach with white-knuckled ambitions of singular success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Foolish the doctor who despises the knowledge acquired by the ancients." ‚Äî Hippocrates&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today in America, we do not hold any formal, ritualized postpartum tradition. The average American woman is discharged from the hospital within 48 hours of birth, and she is compelled by her employer to return to work after two weeks. The average American family lives far from relatives. The average American neighbor doesn‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on next door. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are more likely to survive than our forebears, but far less likely to continue having children. TikTok is saturated with mom content describing the intense loneliness American women feel in the exile of motherhood. As Tim Carney points out in his recent book, "&lt;a href="https://helenroy.substack.com/p/family-unfriendly-how-our-culture" target="_blank"&gt;Family Unfriendly&lt;/a&gt;," neither the infrastructure nor the culture of modern America is conducive to domestic harmony. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;History informs us of alternatives. Contra the modern attitude toward motherhood, childbirth, independence, the nature of the female body, and what matters in life, every civilized pre-industrial society held strict traditional rules ‚Äî prohibitions &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; requirements ‚Äî for women and their relatives to abide by during the period of time following childbirth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These rules carved out a time and space for mothers and their babies to convalesce, physically and spiritually, for all the ways they were uniquely vulnerable. It was also thought ‚Äî across cultures! ‚Äî that the preservation of a woman‚Äôs health during postpartum would prefigure good health in menopause.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medical literature holds that the involution of the uterus after childbirth takes approximately six weeks. This concept is not unlike what is found in the Bible; in the Old Testament, women were considered ‚Äúimpure‚Äù for 40 days after the birth of a boy and 80 days after the birth of a girl. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúImpurity,‚Äù in this case, is not a matter of spiritual degradation, as the English translation may suggest. It is a matter of &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;ritual separation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; of human blood from the sanctuary of the temple. A woman bleeds as long as her uterus is returning to normal size. For most women, that means she‚Äôs bleeding, or is at risk of hemorrhage, for at least six weeks. Ancient Jews held a ritual ‚Äúpurification‚Äù of women 40 days after birth. Early Christians upheld and elaborated on that tradition through what is known now as ‚Äú&lt;a href="https://www.irishfamilyhistorycentre.com/article/churching/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the churching of women&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.‚Äù &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In "&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/First-Forty-Days-Essential-Nourishing/dp/B08ZBM2RZV" target="_blank"&gt;The First Forty Days: The Essential Art of Nourishing the New Mother&lt;/a&gt;," Heng Ou, a Chinese-American mother, describes the ancient Chinese tradition of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/i-tried-the-chinese-practice-of-sitting-the-month-after-childbirth/2017/01/06/54517ee0-ad0b-11e6-a31b-4b6397e625d0_story.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;zuoyuezi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, ‚Äúsitting the month,‚Äù where after a baby is born, the mother‚Äôs mother, grandmother, or an aunt moves in to nourish her, manage her home, and keep her warm following childbirth.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Mexico, the traditional &lt;a href="https://www.babycenter.com/baby/postpartum-health/bringing-back-the-hispanic-tradition-of-cuarentena-after-chi_10346386" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;cuarentena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; requires women to avoid cold showers, drink lots of hot soups and milk, wear a postpartum &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;faja&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and be fully clothed with pants, socks, and a sweater. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the &lt;a href="https://www.healthhub.sg/live-healthy/malay_confinement_practices#:~:text=During%20confinement%2C%20some%20new%20mums,to%20keep%20the%20body%20warm." target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Malays&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a birth is regarded as a gift bestowed by God. New mothers are often cared for by their mothers or mothers-in-law. During Malay confinement, new mothers will bathe in warm water that has been boiled with lemongrass and ginger to promote circulation in the body. They practice post-natal massage to tighten and tone muscles around the abdomen, revitalize their energy, and improve circulation. The Malays also originated &lt;a href="https://www.orchardbirths.com/belly-binding#:~:text=Bengkung%20Belly%20Binding%20is%20considered,more%20popular%20in%20the%20US." target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;bengkung&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; belly binding, a tradition of wrapping the abdominal muscles to bring the musculature of the waist back together after birth ‚Äî a practice that has recently become popular in Western crunchy and celebrity circles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"The march of science and technology does not imply growing intellectual complexity in the lives of most people. It often means the opposite." ‚Äî Thomas Sowell&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No such acknowledgement of change, of vulnerability, or of status is built into American women's initiation into motherhood. Modernity ‚Äî modern technology, including clean water systems, antibiotics, ultrasound, and to an extent, standardized systems of care ‚Äî enables our historically excellent survival rate. What a luxury that we have forgotten how high infant and maternal mortality has been in the past! But what did modern society exchange, however indirectly or unintentionally, for lower infant and maternal mortality?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it was intergenerational interdependence for a sense of certainty. Wisdom for intelligence. Community for commodity. The critical function of midwives, grandmothers, and sisters-in-law ‚Äî tending vulnerable, familial women and children ‚Äî has been almost universally outsourced to the medical profession. But the medical profession optimizes for efficiency, reducing the lying-in period to the minimum amount of time necessary to ensure that mom and baby aren‚Äôt going to die. That becomes the new standard of care. The tradition of a month of rest became not just optional; it was forgotten entirely. Basic survival is a fine goal ‚Äî but is it sufficient if our ultimate purpose is to promote true human flourishing? And are the apparent trade-offs we‚Äôve made &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;actually &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;mutually exclusive?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was lucky, comparatively: There was no office to which I needed to return days postpartum, my husband has always been attentive and loving, and my child and I were both born into an era of maternal and neonatal &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;survival&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Still, I suffered as a consequence of chronic sleeplessness, stress, and nutrient deficiency. My symptoms seemed to indicate a chronic inflammation issue that is basically illegible to Western medical professionals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What was behind the chronic stress? If I can be honest: loneliness, anxiety, ignorance, and stubborn resistance to true rest. Critically, I lacked the company of a more experienced woman to show me the ropes. My birth trauma had convinced me my baby would die if I ever lost sight of her. The internet didn‚Äôt help. I hadn‚Äôt met my friends yet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is where my Americanness helped me after initially hurting me: Having reached my threshold for suffering, I prayed and resolved that I‚Äôd develop a better system for the next time I gave birth, and set forth testing several practices and products cobbled together from the various folk traditions I mentioned already. I asked: What principles of postpartum care are &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;universally recognized&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regulatory agencies may lag when it comes to innovation, but there are factions of the scientific community that are catching up to the ancestral wisdom by systematically verifying its efficacy. Doctors like Aviva Romm have inspired a new generation of practitioners to take herbal medicine seriously, and the studies coming out about the effectiveness of herbs such as &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5376420/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;holy basil&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, used in common folk postpartum care are promising. Discovering Dr. Romm was life-changing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following postpartum principles helped me not only maintain but improve my health, sanity, hair, and skin after my second and third children were born. It‚Äôs never been easy, but never again did I experience the cold exile of isolation, exhaustion, hormonal chaos, and depression that haunted the first year of my first daughter‚Äôs life. These are where I‚Äôd start if I could go back in time. I hope they help you, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Female Friendship&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúA woman's function is laborious, but because it is gigantic, not because it is minute. I will pity Mrs. Jones for the hugeness of her task; I will never pity her for its smallness." ‚Äî G.K. Chesterton&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If one thing unites every postpartum tradition across the world, it is female-to-female care. In case anyone needs reminding: Having a baby is a uniquely female experience. Husbands should be intensely interested and supportive of their wives‚Äô needs, but there are things they cannot know and solutions they cannot intuit because of the limitations of their experience. In so many ways, postpartum begins a new season of formation, and you will need a teacher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find female friends.&lt;/em&gt; Find surrogate (not literally) mothers if yours doesn‚Äôt live nearby or is otherwise disposed. If you‚Äôre expecting, new to a place, and you have the money, invest in a postpartum doula, night nurse, or mother‚Äôs helper. There are some apps now, including Peanut, where you can search to meet buddies, but I think the best kind of friendships happen when you cannot choose your precise qualifications for what you think you like in someone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Church communities often (not always) provide some kind of preformed social connections ‚Äî and a shared worldview upon which new connections can be forged. Hobby groups can‚Äôt guarantee ideological uniformity, but participation in one at least signifies that the participant values the human experience more than scrolling TikTok endlessly in their spare time ‚Äî that‚Äôs a red pill of its own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crunchy Facebook mom groups may be another good place to go spelunking for friends. Start your own group message and let people know when you‚Äôre heading to the gym or the park or wherever. The key is to tap into and make yourself useful within existing networks of women; even if you don‚Äôt find your bestie on the first shot, you will learn more about what, and who, is out there. If your efforts are fruitful, these will be the women that talk you through dark days, bring you food, babysit your kids, become godparents to your kids, and watch your kids grow up. &lt;em&gt;Love them well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Seclusion, not isolation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúWe live, in fact, in a world starved for solitude, silence, and private: and therefore starved for meditation and true friendship.‚Äù ‚Äî C. S. Lewis&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúBouncing back‚Äù ‚Äî the vapid expectation that women ‚Äúbe back in their pre-pregnancy jeans‚Äù within the month ‚Äî is mirrored by the expectation that immediately after the pains of childbirth have passed, the new mother is as emotionally and mentally sharp as ever. Clinical postpartum depression and anxiety aside, this is an amazingly ignorant expectation, and it requires its witting or unwitting believers to also believe the ‚Äúmind in a vat‚Äù account of human nature: The mind and body are easily and completely distinguishable, the latter easily overcome by the former. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically speaking, postpartum convalescence was about much more than the body, since the body was never understood as totally distinct from the mind. In order to protect one‚Äôs peace, new mothers should remain sequestered from strangers, outsiders, and, truly, anyone they do not trust. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even some traditionalist circles seem to do progressivism with extra steps in this regard, with some women returning to Latin mass within 48 hours of giving birth. Recovery is not a competition. Though it‚Äôs rarely articulated and difficult to dig up historically, there &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; a robust tradition of postpartum rest for Christian mothers. &lt;em&gt;Do not allow yourself to be made to feel guilty or extravagant for taking your forty days of seclusion if you can arrange your life in such a way that it‚Äôs possible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Warmth&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another simple and universal truth of traditional postpartum care: for the full forty days, keep your body warm, especially your feet and belly. Wear wool socks. Never be without a blanket. Warm baths with herbs, epsom salts, regular salt, baking soda, and lavender essential oil can be lifegiving. If you get your hair wet, dry immediately with heat. I use a heating pad over the uterus which also helps with afterbirth pains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Vitamin A is for Animal&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúLet food be your medicine and medicine be your food.‚Äù ‚Äî Hippocrates&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breastmilk is extremely high in vitamin A, a vitamin that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has made a point to fearmonger against because isotretinoin (a highly concentrated form of synthetic Vitamin A, sold commercially as Accutane) is teratogenic to fetuses in utero. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, the rules ACOG sets for pregnancy are meant to be followed postpartum. Out of an ‚Äúabundance of caution,‚Äù doctors instruct nervous new moms to avoid Vitamin A. Don‚Äôt eat liver, they say; too much Vitamin A could cause birth defects. While the latter part of that statement may be strictly true, it is an embellishment bordering on a lie, the consequences of which are staggering and, though not as obviously harmful as extreme birth defects, still painful.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Weston A. Price, a dentist who studied the bone structure of indigenous versus industrial peoples in the 1930s, concluded that modern people‚Äôs abandonment of Vitamin A-rich animal protein such as organ meats has led to underdeveloped jaws, crooked teeth, and breathing issues due to structural abnormalities in the modern face. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Price discovered that the diets of healthy traditional peoples contained at least 10 times as much vitamin A as the American diet of his day. His work revealed that vitamin A is one of several fat-soluble activators present only in animal fats and necessary for the assimilation of minerals in the diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the pregnant and postpartum mom, vitamin A deficiency can look like cystic acne, low &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1856040/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;progesterone&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and immune issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TLDR: you need to be consuming animal products. Every ancient tradition of postpartum care abides by this principle, leaning heavily into animal proteins and fats. Raw milk is preferable because the pasteurization process removes most of the Vitamin A and enzymes from the product. Organ meats are great. You can take the liver in capsule form. Steak is great. Chicken and bone broth are great. I put gelatin in everywhere it can dissolve without detection. In my experience, animal proteins are the nutritional necessity for postpartum. No vegan diets allowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Rest and Prayer&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you haven‚Äôt already downloaded the Hallow app, it may be a good investment for your transition from maiden to mother. There are times when the exhaustion, the frequent interruptions, and the general sense of spontaneity will interrupt all your best laid plans for a 15-minute meditative prayer. "For everything there is a season, a time for every activity under heaven. A time to be born and a time to die. A time to plant and a time to harvest." (Ecclesiastes 3:1-2)This is a time to be born; when a baby is born, so is a mother. You may need to relearn how prayer happens throughout the day. You may learn what it really means to pray without ceasing. Hallow can help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So many of the postpartum traditions I explored were inherited from a pre-Christian culture where a certain amount of superstition about protecting the baby from things like ‚Äúthe evil eye‚Äù was baked in. I think the truth in that impulse is that a woman can be as spiritually vulnerable as she is physically and emotionally in the days following childbirth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it‚Äôs good practice to simply acknowledge this. You will power through by God‚Äôs grace, but acknowledge it. Acknowledge your need for rest, and understand that Christ invites us to rest, to &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;abide&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in Him. We have to do that, even if we‚Äôve been trained by the careerist culture never to flinch or take a break. We women especially have some things to unlearn here. It‚Äôs important to remember that we have a God-given &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;female&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; body and vocation to honor and uphold. &lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Barron Trump to enter politics as Florida delegate at GOP convention</title><link>https://www.foxnews.com/politics/barron-trump-enter-politics-florida-delegate-gop-convention</link><description>Barron Trump, the youngest child of former President Trump will enter the political fray for the first time when he will be an at-large delegate to the Republican National Convention.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 12:01:29 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Journalist Jonathan Choe Clearly Struck a Nerve as University ‚ÄúActivists‚Äù Doxx Him . . .

expand=1]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the juiciest stories happen in the backyard of ‚ÄúSaturday Night Live.‚Äù It‚Äôs the Big Apple, and there‚Äôs never a dull moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider privileged college students trashing a campus building in between chanting for violence against Jews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs a truth-to-power moment for the Not Ready for Prime Time Players! (That‚Äôs the name given to the show‚Äôs wild and crazy cast in the ‚Äò70s.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not exactly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúSNL‚Äù brewed the weakest comic tea possible out of the Columbia U protests. The show‚Äôs latest &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3sJBQpd1hc&amp;amp;t=115s" target="_blank"&gt;cold open&lt;/a&gt; followed three parents conflicted about the raging pro-Palestinian protests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Show stalwart Kenan Thompson drew a few smiles through sheer force of will. The city‚Äôs sizable Jewish population, alas, likely wasn‚Äôt amused. Nor was anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, during the ‚ÄúWeekend Update‚Äù segment, coanchor Michael Che clucked his tongue over the Columbia U violence-a-palooza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, it‚Äôs not happening in their studio, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add it all together, and it‚Äôs the perfect symbol of ‚ÄúSNL‚Äù betraying its once-great legacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Jon Stewart as ... a broken clock&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jon Stewart told the truth again. He must want an early exit from his ‚ÄúDaily Show‚Äù gig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The far-left comedian riffed on President Joe Biden during a Netflix comedy special, and he couldn‚Äôt hold back about the &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jon-stewart-trump-may-be-scary-biden-too-old-president-2024-5" target="_blank"&gt;aging leader‚Äôs, well, age&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm not saying that Biden can't contribute to society, he just shouldn't be president.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever Stewart steps a toe off the progressive plantation, he gets an earful. Remember the outrage when he said the COVID-19 virus likely came from ... the Wuhan Lab experimenting with viruses?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He‚Äôll get more not-so-friendly fire again and likely revert to his ‚ÄúOrange Man Bad‚Äù playbook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kristen Stewart is ... box-office poison&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kristen Stewart loves making movies no one wants to see. Her 2020 thriller ‚ÄúUnderwater‚Äù barely drew a crowd. Neither did ‚ÄúSpencer‚Äù (2021) or ‚ÄúCrimes of the Future‚Äù (2022). She followed them up with this year‚Äôs ‚ÄúLove Lies Bleeding.‚Äù The grind-house thriller leaned hard into its lesbian sex scenes, keeping some folks away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, she pouted to the press that people were offended by her ‚Äúracy‚Äù lesbian photo spread, even though she seemed like the only person paying attention to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voila! The film earned a pathetic $8.3 million earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, she‚Äôs vowing to scare away even more fans with her next project. Her directorial debut, ‚ÄúThe Chronology of Water,‚Äù features ‚Äúincest and periods and a woman violently repossessing her voice and body,‚Äù &lt;a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/kristen-stewart-says-directorial-debut-is-about-incest-and-periods/" target="_blank"&gt;she told the press.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, she admits audiences want to see ‚ÄúJesus and dogs‚Äù on screen, but her inner artist demands more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few more flops, and she‚Äôll don a chastity belt and beg for a ‚ÄúTwilight‚Äù reunion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Michael Rapaport risks 'safety'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Robert De Niro roasts Donald Trump for the 14th time in a week, it makes all the news outlets. Reporters can‚Äôt get enough of it, and they‚Äôll share the quotes far and wide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a Jewish star‚Äôs freedom of speech gets squelched? Crickets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actor-turned-comic Michael Rapaport learned that lesson. The ‚ÄúBeautiful Girls‚Äù alum‚Äôs stand-up gig got canceled over the proverbial heckler‚Äôs veto. Rapaport is both Jewish and a staunch defender of Israel. That makes him a ripe target for today‚Äôs ‚ÄúPro-Palestinian‚Äù mobs, who try to silence him at every turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shockingly, said mob failed to do so &lt;a href="https://www.portlandmercury.com/comedy/2024/01/09/46971994/why-are-people-protesting-michael-rapaports-portland-comedy-shows" target="_blank"&gt;a few weeks ago in Portland&lt;/a&gt;. His luck ran out in Madison, Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason? &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/comedian-michael-rapaport-stunned-show-allegedly-canceled-over-pro-israel-views-p-off" target="_blank"&gt;‚ÄúSafety concerns.‚Äù&lt;/a&gt; AKA the ‚Äúheckler‚Äôs veto‚Äù on steroids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rapaport joins a growing list of Jewish artists canceled for their views. Author/actor Brett Gelman of ‚ÄúStranger Things‚Äù fame saw &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2024/03/stranger-things-actor-brett-gelman-signing-canceled-book-soup-safety-concerns-1235849470/" target="_blank"&gt;several bookstore appearances canceled&lt;/a&gt; this year.

Except that may not happen, either. The dedicated Trump critic says he &lt;a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/michael-rapaport-goes-scorched-earth-on-biden-and-progressive-democrats" target="_self"&gt;might just vote for him&lt;/a&gt; come November thanks to our feckless current leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best news of the week?

Elsie Stephens, the victim's older sister asked WCAU before adding, "You have a mother and a father; how could you just beat a man until you take off half of his skull?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities also charged a 14-year-old male as an adult with murder in connection with the attack, but his charges were dismissed, the &lt;a href="https://archive.is/9zBsN/again?url=https://www.inquirer.com/crime/james-lambert-traffic-cone-philadelphia-charges-20240328.html#selection-1311.0-1311.319" target="_blank"&gt;Philadelphia Inquirer reported&lt;/a&gt; in March. Other kids turned themselves into police but ultimately weren't charged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Inquirer had the following to say in regard to Mosley:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In late February, Mosley‚Äôs case was decertified and sent to juvenile court, and she was adjudicated delinquent of murder, conspiracy, and possession of an instrument of crime, according to records. Court administrators did not respond to questions about her sentence. Mosley‚Äôs lawyer, Susan M. Lin, declined to comment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following are more examples of very young female teens and preteens accused of carrying out violent acts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Girls, 12 and 13, accused of beating disabled man to death ‚Äî then walking away in a 'celebratory mood'&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="rm-shortcode" style="display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three girls ‚Äî one 12-year-old and two 13-year-olds ‚Äî were accused of viciously beating a disabled man and leaving him for dead in a &lt;a href="https://www.theblaze.com/tag/washington" target="_self"&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, alley in 2023. The trio allegedly walked away from the "horrific" beatdown in a "celebratory mood." Prosecutors said there is graphic video of the young girls brutally attacking 64-year-old Reggie Brown. An unknown male in his 20s initiated the assault, police said, noting the male reportedly grabbed Brown by the collar and threw him against a brick wall. According to the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/03/30/us-news/three-girls-arrested-for-beating-disabled-man-to-death-on-dc-street/" target="_blank"&gt;New York Post&lt;/a&gt;, the girls were walking by at the time and one of them asked the male, "Can I fight him?‚Äù The male replied, "Yes." The girls allegedly chased Brown down an alley and threw him to the ground, after which they repeatedly kicked and stomped Brown in the head on the concrete, reportedly pulled down Brown's pants, took off his belt, and then beat him with his own belt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8 teen girls charged with beating, stabbing to death 59-year-old man in Toronto ‚Äî 3 suspects are 13 years old&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="rm-shortcode" style="display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the three 13-year-olds, police said three 14-year-old girls and two 16-year-old suspects were arrested in the December 2022 "swarming" attack. The victim was found on a street suffering from multiple stab wounds and later was pronounced dead at a hospital, ABC News said. Police said a number of weapons were recovered from the suspects, but the names of the suspects ‚Äî all of whom were charged with murder ‚Äî were not released due to their ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Two 12-year-old females¬†charged with aggravated assault in¬†a violent attack that left 55-year-old¬†woman unconscious and in critical condition&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="rm-shortcode" style="display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police said the victim was "assaulted to the point of unconsciousness" on a train platform in Edmonton, Alberta, and was hospitalized with significant head and facial injuries, &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/two-12-year-olds-charged-in-attack-at-edmonton-lrt-station-that-left-woman-in-critical-condition-1.7049430" target="_blank"&gt;CBC News said&lt;/a&gt;.

She reportedly told the group she identifies as Hispanic and started to walk away, but one of the teens chased her and pulled her down by her hair.
