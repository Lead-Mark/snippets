Today's chart shows the S&amp;P 500 index with all the days where it closed at least 2% lower marked in blue. For every one of those -2% closes, it shows how many stocks in the index closed higher despite the lower overall close. Yesterday, 165 stocks – 33% of the index – closed higher even though the index fell by 2.3%. This was the highest number by far in the past 10 years. What does this mean? I explain more in the Insight of the Day.

Today's chart shows the Volatility Index (VIX). You can see it spiking during the April pullback and then coming back down in May as the market recovered. It spiked again in the second half of last week as the market retreated slightly. We’ll have to see if the VIX goes back down this week. If it doesn’t, we could be in for another shallow pullback. If you’ve followed this newsletter for any length of time, you’ll recognize it for what it is. I explain more in the Insight of the Day.
