On June 24, I posted a chart of the Equal-Weight S&amp;P 500 index, highlighting a bullish wedge pattern that could signal a strong breakout. It took a few weeks, but the index broke out last week. Along with the small-cap breakout, it looks like participation in this bull market is steadily widening. This provides the necessary foundation for it to continue for potentially many months longer. Don’t sit this one out.

Last Wednesday, I shared a chart showing a bullish wedge pattern in the small-cap Russell 2000 and predicted a breakout. Well, look at what happened in the two trading days right after that. Small-caps are indeed breaking out, setting us up for a “small-cap summer.” If this plays out, it’s going to be hugely positive for us. I explain why in the Insight of the Day.

In their last monetary policy meeting, the Fed forecasted just one rate cut this year. Swap traders don’t believe them, pricing in two instead. After yesterday’s cooler-than-expected CPI report, those traders will likely be proven correct. Now is not the time to sit out of this bull market. But you should be mindful of how it may be shifting.

Today's chart shows how long past bull markets have lasted. Our current bull market is 21 months old, while the average bull market lasts 61 months. Although the 2020 bull market only lasted 21 months, that was an anomaly. There's no guarantee, but the data suggests this bull market could continue for quite a while. I explain some key drivers in the Insight of the Day. The post Will This Bull Market End Soon?
