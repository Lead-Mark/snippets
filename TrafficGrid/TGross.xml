Today's chart shows the number of stocks hitting new 52-week lows. The 2022 bear market is captured in the first rectangle on the left, while the current selloff is in the smaller rectangle on the right. There's still a huge gap between then and now. Yes, there was a substantial spike recently, but it has come down significantly. Does this mean the selloff is over? Not necessarily. But amid all the fear, it’s crucial to maintain perspective. Without it, you’ll miss the opportunities still out there. I explain more in the Insight of the Day.

Today's chart shows the number of people who reported not being able to work in July due to the weather, dating back to 1976. This year, nearly half a million people couldn't work last month because of the weather. Hurricane Beryl alone knocked out power to nearly 3 million in Houston, with many still reeling. This suggests recession fears may be overblown. While negative momentum might not stop immediately, this insight helps us position ourselves wisely. I explain more in the Insight of the Day.

Volatility spiked on Friday and again today, reaching its highest level since the Covid Crash of 2020. Recession fears are back, causing the S&amp;P 500 to close lower for three consecutive weeks and the Nasdaq to enter correction territory, down over 10% from its recent high. But let’s put things in perspective: the S&amp;P 500 is back at early June levels, and the Nasdaq is at late May levels. This drop is minor compared to the bull market that began in October 2022. There are always opportunities in the market, which I explain in the Insight of the Day.

Today's chart shows how the S&amp;P 500 has moved on “Fed days” since March 2022. Yesterday’s market movement was par for the course. The tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped nearly 3%, as expected. But even though the Fed’s message seems “clear,” most traders are forgetting one critical thing right now. I explain in the Insight of the Day.
