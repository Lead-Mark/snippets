Today’s chart highlights the Volatility Index (VIX), which has settled back to levels last seen at the end of July after a sharp spike earlier this month.

Today’s chart reveals the current cost of hedging against a 10% drop in the S&amp;P 500, which is the highest it’s been since October 2023. Back then, the market bounced back quickly, making that downside protection unnecessary. But this time, the outcome might be different.

Still, don’t let this volatility keep you from seizing the opportunities that are out there.
