We’re just over two years into this bull market, with the S&amp;P 500 already up around 65%. While that might feel like things are getting frothy, history tells us we’re likely still early.

Historically, inflows into stock funds are quiet before a Presidential election and surge afterward. But this year’s been different—stock fund inflows have been strong well before Election Day.
