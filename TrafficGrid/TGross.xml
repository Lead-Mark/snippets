As you may know, September is historically one of the toughest months for the S&amp;P 500. But here’s what’s interesting—it’s usually the second half that’s the weakest. Next week, we’ll see if the Fed can break this pattern. Will they lift the market, or will seasonality prevail? Either way, there’s always good news to uncover, and I dive into that today.

Today's chart tracks the SMH ETF, which covers semiconductor stocks. The red line shows the 200-day moving average, a key indicator of long-term support. Over the past year, semis have tested this support three times, and each time it’s held strong – including earlier this week. With semiconductors leading the AI rally, this is a great sign for the market’s overall health. But remember, leadership can always shift without derailing the bull market.

There’s currently $6.3 trillion sitting on the sidelines in money market funds – the highest we’ve seen in months. With risk appetite fading, it’s no surprise this pile of cash is growing. But here’s the key: when the Fed begins cutting rates and risk appetite returns, this cash could flood back into the markets fast. This surge could catch many off guard, but not those paying attention. Don’t be one of the surprised – be prepared.

By adding a volume profile to the S&amp;P 500 chart, we get a clearer view of key trading levels. The 545 and 530 zones have seen high-volume activity, acting as magnets for price movement. But it’s the low-volume 538 level I’m watching closely. Historically, levels like this get rejected or blown through quickly. If we don’t see a bounce next week, the selloff could continue. Even so, there are still opportunities in individual stocks if your trading edge holds up in a negative momentum environment.
