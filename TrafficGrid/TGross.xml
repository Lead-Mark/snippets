This chart breaks down how the S&amp;P 500 typically reacts—both daily and in the final hour of trading—under different Fed chairs. Powell? So far, he holds the worst average, especially in that critical final hour on Fed day. If we see a dip later, it wouldn’t be surprising. But here’s the bigger picture: Powell’s record is skewed by one of the fastest rate-hiking cycles ever, and despite that, he’s overseen one of history’s strongest bull markets. What does this mean for us? I break it down today.

The Equal-Weight S&amp;P 500 (RSP) has been quietly pulling back this month, slipping below its 21-day moving average and nearing its 50-day. Most traders are missing this “hidden” pullback because they’re focused on market-cap weighted indexes, which are being propped up by the Magnificent 7 stocks. This divergence also explains why the Nasdaq closed higher last week. The real question is—how can we take advantage of this pullback? I break it all down in today’s Insight of the Day.

This chart highlights the number of 5% or greater pullbacks during past bull markets. The average bull market sees eight such pullbacks, but so far in this one, we’ve only experienced five. And that’s just counting the “deep” ones. The Equal-Weight S&amp;P 500 pullback I mentioned yesterday? It’s barely over 3%. The takeaway? We’re not seeing “too many” pullbacks at all. The data is clear—stay in the game. I explain more in today’s Insight of the Day.

This chart tracks the net difference between 52-week highs and lows on the NYSE. While we’re still seeing more highs than lows, that gap is shrinking. Let me be clear—this isn’t a signal of an impending bear market. But it does indicate pullbacks in smaller, less-popular stocks. For traders like us, that’s an opportunity to scoop up the most explosive names at much better prices. I dive into the details in today’s Insight of the Day.

The chart above shows the RSP, the Equal-Weight S&amp;P 500 Index. While the Magnificent Seven stocks are pushing the broader S&amp;P 500 higher, the equal-weight version tells a different story. It just dipped below its 21-day moving average, signaling a potential pullback. This could be a prime buying opportunity that most investors haven’t noticed yet.
