The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index tracks how actual economic results measure up against forecasts.

This week's sentiment indicator from the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) shows a sharp dip in bullish sentiment, now at one of the lowest levels all year. While this might seem like an overreaction—likely influenced by the upcoming election—there's good news. When individual investors overreact like this, it often creates opportunities. I explain why below.

Today's chart shows the percentage of stocks trading above their 50-day moving average, a key indicator of the market’s medium-term trend. Right now, that percentage is dipping sharply. But if you look closely, similar dips earlier this year turned out to be great buying opportunities. Is it guaranteed to happen again? No. But the odds are in our favor. Don’t miss out while you still can.

One of the best things about the American stock market is its openness. Investors worldwide can—and do—invest here, adding to its strength. Today’s chart shows that international investors are flocking to our market, and this demand is fueling the bull market's momentum. That’s why I believe we have a lot more room to run. Keep riding the bull.

Today's chart reveals how large speculators—the big money—are positioned in the futures of the small-cap Russell 2000. Without diving into futures contracts, the key takeaway is that the more these traders buy, the more bullish they are. Right now, they’re the most bullish on small-caps in nearly four years.
