Last Wednesday, I shared a chart showing a bullish wedge pattern in the small-cap Russell 2000 and predicted a breakout. Well, look at what happened in the two trading days right after that. Small-caps are indeed breaking out, setting us up for a “small-cap summer.” If this plays out, it’s going to be hugely positive for us. I explain why in the Insight of the Day.

In their last monetary policy meeting, the Fed forecasted just one rate cut this year. Swap traders don’t believe them, pricing in two instead. After yesterday’s cooler-than-expected CPI report, those traders will likely be proven correct. Now is not the time to sit out of this bull market. But you should be mindful of how it may be shifting.

Today's chart shows how long past bull markets have lasted. Our current bull market is 21 months old, while the average bull market lasts 61 months. Although the 2020 bull market only lasted 21 months, that was an anomaly. There's no guarantee, but the data suggests this bull market could continue for quite a while. I explain some key drivers in the Insight of the Day. The post Will This Bull Market End Soon?

Today's chart shows the small-cap Russell 2000 Index forming a classic bullish wedge pattern.

Today's chart shows the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield, which has been reliably negatively correlated with stock prices for the past couple of years. When yields rise, stocks go down, and when yields fall, stocks go up. Since mid-April, Treasury yields have been in a downward channel pattern. This signals that – at least in the near term – we should still be aggressive with our trading. If this trend reverses, we should be more cautious. As I explain in the Insight of the Day, selective aggression is key.
