While the S&amp;P 500 just hit new all-time highs, the Equal-Weighted S&amp;P 500 (RSP) was already soaring days before the Fed's rate cut. Most traders missed this early surge because they only focus on the "obvious" market metrics. But as I’ll explain in today’s Insight, the biggest opportunities are often hidden beneath the surface. That’s why I rely on insider trading activity to uncover those overlooked chances. Tomorrow, I’ll reveal a red-hot opportunity in a tiny biotech stock during my live masterclass.

When the Fed cuts rates while the S&amp;P 500 is at or near all-time highs, history shows a clear pattern: the index tends to be up 9.8% a year later. But in the short term, it's a different story.
