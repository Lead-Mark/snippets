The percentage of stocks trading above their 50-day moving averages has jumped from 27% to 48% in just over a week. That’s a strong rebound, but here’s the key: this type of surge in participation isn’t unusual in healthy bull markets—it’s expected. What does this mean for the rally ahead?

This week’s AAII sentiment survey shows individual investors are at their most bearish since November 2023—right before the market surged. History tells us that when bearish sentiment peaks, it’s often a bullish signal. Of course, nothing is guaranteed, but when you pair this with two other compelling factors I outline below, the odds start to look very much in your favor. Don’t miss this opportunity—I explain why in today’s Insight.

The relationship between the 10-year Treasury yield and the stock market has been intriguing during this bull market. Typically, higher yields mean lower stock prices—and lately, that’s held true. But yesterday brought a twist: the largest drop in 10-year yields since December 2023. This could signal a turning point, especially with short positions in Treasury bonds at record highs. If yields keep falling, those shorts could fuel an even steeper decline—great news for stocks. I unpack the implications in today’s Insight.

Earnings season is here, and the data tells a compelling story. This chart highlights the S&amp;P 500’s estimated quarterly earnings versus actual results, and the trend is clear: actual earnings usually outperform estimates—even during tough markets like 2022.
