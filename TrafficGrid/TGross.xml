I used to work at JP Morgan, the most bearish bank on the chart, and I can tell you firsthand—they’re not shorting the market the way their predictions suggest. Wall Street plays sneaky games, manipulating sentiment to their advantage. But there’s another group with even more power: corporate insiders. These insiders trade on inside intel, and that’s how we can profit too. Later today at 11 a.m. ET, I’m hosting a masterclass to show you how to spot the best insider moves and the three most powerful insider buying signals. Don’t miss out—lock in your spot now!

While the S&amp;P 500 just hit new all-time highs, the Equal-Weighted S&amp;P 500 (RSP) was already soaring days before the Fed's rate cut. Most traders missed this early surge because they only focus on the "obvious" market metrics. But as I’ll explain in today’s Insight, the biggest opportunities are often hidden beneath the surface. That’s why I rely on insider trading activity to uncover those overlooked chances. Tomorrow, I’ll reveal a red-hot opportunity in a tiny biotech stock during my live masterclass.

When the Fed cuts rates while the S&amp;P 500 is at or near all-time highs, history shows a clear pattern: the index tends to be up 9.8% a year later. But in the short term, it's a different story. One month after the cut, the median return is negative, especially when factoring in September’s seasonal trends. Don't be surprised if the market dips in the near term, but the longer-term outlook remains bullish. Here's why I believe the market will keep climbing in the months ahead.
