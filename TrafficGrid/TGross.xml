Historically, the last six months should’ve been rough for the markets, but this bull market had other plans. Now, we’re heading into the year’s strongest six-month period. Does this guarantee an even bigger market rally? Of course not—there are no certainties in trading, only probabilities. And as I lay out today, the odds are looking pretty good.

The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index tracks how actual economic results measure up against forecasts. Right now, it's at a six-month high, meaning economic data is coming in much stronger than expected. Most people are underestimating the economy’s strength—likely because of election-driven pessimism. But as I explain today, this overly negative sentiment actually presents a great opportunity.
