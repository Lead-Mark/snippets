The five major Wall Street banks made nearly $15 billion in stock trading profits in the second quarter – 18% higher than last year. As a former VP at one of these banks, this doesn't surprise me. They have the capital to move markets with their trades, leveraging not just their own money but also influencing their top clients' trades. It's not an even playing field, but knowing how the game is played can work to our advantage.

Here's the percentage of stocks trading above their 200-day moving average over the past year. Here’s the percentage of stocks trading above their 50-day moving averages. Since the beginning of this month, the percentages of stocks trading above their 200 and 50-day moving averages have spiked. This means participation in this bull market has been sharply increasing – we’re no longer in a narrow bull market. This expanding base will provide the foundation for the bull market to keep chugging on. But what’s causing this expansion in breadth? And how can we take advantage of it? I’ll explain more in the Insight of the Day.

As of last week, markets were pricing in two 0.25% rate cuts by the Fed by year-end. Now, they’re expecting nearly three. Since the Fed moves rates by at least 0.25%, this means the market anticipates either a 0.50% or 0.75% cut. This expectation of higher rate cuts is a good sign. But as I explain in the Insight of the Day, you don’t want to wait for the rate cuts to happen.

On June 24, I posted a chart of the Equal-Weight S&amp;P 500 index, highlighting a bullish wedge pattern that could signal a strong breakout. It took a few weeks, but the index broke out last week. Along with the small-cap breakout, it looks like participation in this bull market is steadily widening. This provides the necessary foundation for it to continue for potentially many months longer. Don’t sit this one out.

Last Wednesday, I shared a chart showing a bullish wedge pattern in the small-cap Russell 2000 and predicted a breakout. Well, look at what happened in the two trading days right after that. Small-caps are indeed breaking out, setting us up for a “small-cap summer.” If this plays out, it’s going to be hugely positive for us. I explain why in the Insight of the Day.
