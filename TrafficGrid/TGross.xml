Today’s chart shows XLF, the ETF tracking a basket of financial stocks. It’s been on a tear recently, surging well past its mid-July highs as the market anticipates the Fed’s upcoming rate cuts. This is just one example of the pockets of strength I’ve been talking about—and there are plenty more if you know where to look.

Today's chart reveals an intriguing twist from the AAII weekly survey. Despite the sharp selloff on Tuesday, bullish sentiment remains above average, while bearish sentiment has actually decreased. Most would expect the opposite, but the data tells a different story. As I delve into in the Insight of the Day, this divergence is a powerful reminder not to take market signals at face value.

Today's chart highlights the number of days the S&amp;P 500 has experienced downward moves of -1%, -2%, or over -3%. Notice that tiny bar on the right? We’re still well below the historical average. Yes, yesterday was a big down day, but given how few of these we've seen lately, it’s hardly shocking. When you also consider September’s seasonal trends, the market’s behavior makes even more sense.
