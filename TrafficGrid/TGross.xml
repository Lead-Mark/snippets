September and October are typically rough months for the market, as we saw last year before a November surge. While history doesn’t repeat exactly, it often rhymes. Last year, August was negative, but this time it's shaping up to be positive. However, don’t be surprised by short-term weakness ahead—it’s likely just seasonal. When it hits, don’t panic. Instead, recognize it for what it is and use it to your advantage. I break down what to do if that happens in today’s Insight of the Day.

Junk bonds can be a key signal for market sentiment. When investors are willing to take on more risk in these high-yield bonds, it usually means confidence is rising. Today's chart shows how a broad junk bond index has been tracking alongside the stock market, but now it’s breaking out of the range it’s been stuck in all year. This suggests that risk appetite is increasing. If you know how to read these signs, you can position yourself to profit as the market shifts. I explain more in today’s Insight of the Day.

The Nasdaq may still be 4% off its previous highs, but the Equal-Weighted S&amp;P 500 – which downplays the impact of mega-cap tech – already broke through its highs this week. The Russell 3000, covering nearly all U.S. stocks, is also just 1% away from a new peak. This recovery is wider than most people realize. Don’t sit on the sidelines and miss out.
