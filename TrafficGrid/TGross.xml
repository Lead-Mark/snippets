Today's chart shows how the S&amp;P 500 has moved on “Fed days” since March 2022. Yesterday’s market movement was par for the course. The tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped nearly 3%, as expected. But even though the Fed’s message seems “clear,” most traders are forgetting one critical thing right now. I explain in the Insight of the Day.

Today's year-to-date chart compares the Nasdaq 100 with the small-cap Russell 2000. Large-cap tech stocks have pulled back dramatically, erasing almost half their gains this year. Meanwhile, the lagging Russell 2000 has accelerated and overtaken them. And this seems to be only the beginning. Are you ready for the new market leaders?

The top part of today's chart shows the Nasdaq, while the bottom part highlights stocks making new highs (green bars) versus new lows (red bars). The first white rectangle marks the April pullback, where the Nasdaq fell 7% and new lows dominated. Now, in the second white rectangle, the Nasdaq has dropped more than 7%, but new highs outnumber new lows. There's still strength lurking beneath the surface. With Powell speaking tomorrow, this is an opportunity we can exploit. I explain more in the Insight of the Day.

Today's chart shows how the small-cap Russell 2000 index has been performing relative to the large-cap S&amp;P 500 for the past three years. The steady decline in the chart shows that small-caps have been lagging their large-cap counterparts for years. But the current rotation appears to have reversed that trend. In fact, this rotation seems to have broken past the declining trend line, suggesting it will likely continue. There are no guarantees, but the odds are in our favor. This is an opportunity we shouldn’t miss. I explain more in the Insight of the Day.
