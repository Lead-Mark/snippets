Today's chart shows the S&amp;P 500 index with all the days where it closed at least 2% lower marked in blue. For every one of those -2% closes, it shows how many stocks in the index closed higher despite the lower overall close. Yesterday, 165 stocks – 33% of the index – closed higher even though the index fell by 2.3%. This was the highest number by far in the past 10 years. What does this mean? I explain more in the Insight of the Day.

Today's chart shows the Volatility Index (VIX). You can see it spiking during the April pullback and then coming back down in May as the market recovered. It spiked again in the second half of last week as the market retreated slightly. We’ll have to see if the VIX goes back down this week. If it doesn’t, we could be in for another shallow pullback. If you’ve followed this newsletter for any length of time, you’ll recognize it for what it is. I explain more in the Insight of the Day.

Here's the percentage of stocks trading above their 200-day moving average over the past year. Here’s the percentage of stocks trading above their 50-day moving averages. Since the beginning of this month, the percentages of stocks trading above their 200 and 50-day moving averages have spiked. This means participation in this bull market has been sharply increasing – we’re no longer in a narrow bull market. This expanding base will provide the foundation for the bull market to keep chugging on. But what’s causing this expansion in breadth? And how can we take advantage of it?
