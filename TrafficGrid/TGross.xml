The small-cap Russell 2000 has been lagging behind other major indexes, still sitting below its 2021 highs. But as the chart shows, it’s now on the verge of a breakout. If it clears those highs, the potential upside for small-cap traders like us could be massive. Here’s the thing, though—you don’t need to wait for the breakout to act.

The Equal-Weight S&amp;P 500 Index (RSP) just hit a new high, even as the traditional S&amp;P 500 lags behind its mid-November levels. This flip is rare in this bull market, where larger-cap names typically lead the way. But something is shifting beneath the surface, and it could have major implications for how you trade. I break it all down in today’s Insight.

The small-cap Russell 2000 is showing classic constructive price action. A few weeks ago, I highlighted the ascending triangle pattern it had formed. Since then, the index broke out, pulled back, and is now bouncing back—right on the previous resistance line, which has turned into support. This kind of setup signals opportunity.

Historically, the market tends to resume its rally before the month ends. Despite the election noise, November 2024 is playing out in a way that’s surprisingly consistent with past trends. I break it all down—and explain why staying the course could pay off—in today’s insight.
