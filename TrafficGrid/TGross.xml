In their last monetary policy meeting, the Fed forecasted just one rate cut this year. Swap traders don’t believe them, pricing in two instead. After yesterday’s cooler-than-expected CPI report, those traders will likely be proven correct. Now is not the time to sit out of this bull market. But you should be mindful of how it may be shifting.

Today's chart shows how long past bull markets have lasted. Our current bull market is 21 months old, while the average bull market lasts 61 months. Although the 2020 bull market only lasted 21 months, that was an anomaly. There's no guarantee, but the data suggests this bull market could continue for quite a while. I explain some key drivers in the Insight of the Day. The post Will This Bull Market End Soon?

Today's chart shows the small-cap Russell 2000 Index forming a classic bullish wedge pattern. If this pattern plays out, small-caps could soon break out, providing a solid base for the bull market to continue. So, keep an eye on this. But remember, the buyers are already here.

Today's chart shows the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield, which has been reliably negatively correlated with stock prices for the past couple of years. When yields rise, stocks go down, and when yields fall, stocks go up. Since mid-April, Treasury yields have been in a downward channel pattern. This signals that – at least in the near term – we should still be aggressive with our trading. If this trend reverses, we should be more cautious. As I explain in the Insight of the Day, selective aggression is key.

Today's first chart is an indication of market momentum based on the 125-day moving average, one of the indicators in CNN’s Fear and Greed Index. Personally, I prefer using the 50 and 200-day moving averages, but even with those benchmarks, there’s no denying the S&amp;P 500 has strong momentum. The second chart shows the percent of stocks at 52-week highs compared to 52-week lows. Right now, there are about as many highs as lows, which is typically not a sign of strength. One indicator shows Extreme Greed, another Extreme Fear. No wonder traders are worried. I explain what I think in the Insight of the Day.
