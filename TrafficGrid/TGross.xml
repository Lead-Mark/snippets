The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are setting up a textbook breakout pattern—one of my favorite setups for explosive short-term gains.

The S&amp;P 500 is forming a classic “bull wedge” pattern—one that could signal a major breakout. The same setup is unfolding in the Nasdaq, adding even more weight to the bullish case. No guarantees, of course, but the odds favor an upside move. Understanding this ahead of time gives you a serious edge.
