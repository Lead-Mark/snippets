Today’s chart highlights the Volatility Index (VIX), which has settled back to levels last seen at the end of July after a sharp spike earlier this month.

Today’s chart reveals the current cost of hedging against a 10% drop in the S&amp;P 500, which is the highest it’s been since October 2023. Back then, the market bounced back quickly, making that downside protection unnecessary. But this time, the outcome might be different. So, the big question remains—should you still be buying the dip?

After last Monday’s massive volatility spike, things have calmed down, but we’re still at levels seen during the April 2024 and August–October 2023 pullbacks. If volatility continues to drop this week, it’ll be a good sign for the market. But if it spikes again—especially with inflation data coming in hot—we could be in for more turbulence. Still, don’t let this volatility keep you from seizing the opportunities that are out there.

Yesterday, I showed how most second-quarter earnings are still beating estimates. Today’s chart reveals that analysts have only trimmed their Q3 earnings estimates by an average of 1.8%—right in line with the past decade. This reinforces what I’ve been saying: recession fears are overblown.
