Today, I want to highlight a critical lesson about the dangers of fixating on the “headline-making” stocks—specifically, the Magnificent Seven. While these stocks may grab attention, they've significantly underperformed compared to the rest of the S&amp;P 500 since July's market peak. Don't let their flashy headlines fool you; we remain in a bull market. Join me at 11 a.m. ET for a masterclass where I’ll reveal how to harness insider buying activity to navigate this market effectively. You won’t want to miss it!

Now, the big question is: where’s the market headed next? Wednesday’s CPI report gave us a clue. After an initial selloff, buyers swooped in, sparking a massive reversal by the close. This kind of action, where stocks rally on bad news, points toward higher prices ahead. We’ve seen this pattern before, and if history repeats, we could see stocks surge into the election. Stick around, and I’ll keep you updated on the bull case—it's still in play.

As you may know, September is historically one of the toughest months for the S&amp;P 500. But here’s what’s interesting—it’s usually the second half that’s the weakest. Next week, we’ll see if the Fed can break this pattern. Will they lift the market, or will seasonality prevail? Either way, there’s always good news to uncover, and I dive into that today.

Today's chart tracks the SMH ETF, which covers semiconductor stocks. The red line shows the 200-day moving average, a key indicator of long-term support. Over the past year, semis have tested this support three times, and each time it’s held strong – including earlier this week. With semiconductors leading the AI rally, this is a great sign for the market’s overall health. But remember, leadership can always shift without derailing the bull market.
