The Equal-Weight S&amp;P 500 Index (RSP) just posted a bullish engulfing candle the day after Fed Day, joined by similar patterns in the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq. This means the bears started strong, but the bulls completely took over by day’s end—a powerful signal of momentum. Even better, the follow-up price action confirmed the pattern, and this wasn’t just driven by the Magnificent 7—it was broad-based. Plus, key support levels held firm in the S&amp;P 500. These signs all point to healthy price action. I break it down further in today's Insight of the Day.

This chart reveals how the Volatility Index (VIX) typically behaves after a major spike—like the one we saw on Wednesday. Historically, the VIX tends to settle down in the days following such jumps, and a calmer VIX often signals better days for the markets. We saw this play out after the August 5 selloff, and it could happen again. No guarantees, of course—but the odds seem to favor us. I break it all down in today’s insight.

This is how the market reacted as soon as Powell started talking. His cautious tone about future rate adjustments—after already cutting rates by 1%—wasn’t what investors wanted to hear. The result? The worst selloff since August 5 and a major spike in the VIX. But let’s not forget what happened after that August panic: a swift V-shaped recovery. Is a repeat guaranteed? Of course not—but the odds still look favorable. The key takeaway from this volatility? I break it all down today.

This chart breaks down how the S&amp;P 500 typically reacts—both daily and in the final hour of trading—under different Fed chairs. Powell? So far, he holds the worst average, especially in that critical final hour on Fed day. If we see a dip later, it wouldn’t be surprising. But here’s the bigger picture: Powell’s record is skewed by one of the fastest rate-hiking cycles ever, and despite that, he’s overseen one of history’s strongest bull markets. What does this mean for us? I break it down today.
