Today’s chart reveals the current cost of hedging against a 10% drop in the S&amp;P 500, which is the highest it’s been since October 2023. Back then, the market bounced back quickly, making that downside protection unnecessary. But this time, the outcome might be different. So, the big question remains—should you still be buying the dip?

After last Monday’s massive volatility spike, things have calmed down, but we’re still at levels seen during the April 2024 and August–October 2023 pullbacks. If volatility continues to drop this week, it’ll be a good sign for the market. But if it spikes again—especially with inflation data coming in hot—we could be in for more turbulence. Still, don’t let this volatility keep you from seizing the opportunities that are out there.

Yesterday, I showed how most second-quarter earnings are still beating estimates. Today’s chart reveals that analysts have only trimmed their Q3 earnings estimates by an average of 1.8%—right in line with the past decade. This reinforces what I’ve been saying: recession fears are overblown.

With all the market noise, it’s easy to forget we’re right in the middle of earnings season. But as today’s “scorecard” shows, company earnings remain solid. As of last Friday, 75% of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported Q2 results, with 78% beating estimates—right in line with historical averages. These aren’t “great” results, but they’re solid. Remember, long-term earnings shape stock valuations, and understanding these foundations opens up shorter-term profit opportunities. I explain more in the Insight of the Day.

Today's chart shows the number of stocks hitting new 52-week lows. The 2022 bear market is captured in the first rectangle on the left, while the current selloff is in the smaller rectangle on the right. There's still a huge gap between then and now. Yes, there was a substantial spike recently, but it has come down significantly. Does this mean the selloff is over? Not necessarily. But amid all the fear, it’s crucial to maintain perspective. Without it, you’ll miss the opportunities still out there. I explain more in the Insight of the Day.
