Today’s chart highlights the Volatility Index (VIX), which has settled back to levels last seen at the end of July after a sharp spike earlier this month. While it’s still slightly elevated compared to the average during this bull market, it’s inching closer to a point that could signal smoother sailing ahead. Is this an “all clear” for the bull market? Not necessarily – but it’s a positive sign. Don’t miss out on this potential recovery.
