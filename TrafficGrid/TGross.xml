The S&amp;P 500 is looking more top-heavy than it has in over a decade, and this chart makes it crystal clear. The ratio between the Equal-Weighted S&amp;P 500 Index (RSP) and the regular S&amp;P 500 shows just how much the largest companies dominate right now. But here’s the good news: we’ve been here before, and it hasn’t stopped us from making profits. Don’t let the chatter about “weak participation” scare you off. This rebound still holds opportunity—I explain why in today’s Insight.

The S&amp;P 500 just broke through not one, but two bearish “head-and-shoulders” patterns. The first pattern failed to deliver its bearish signal, and now the second has followed suit—suggesting positive momentum may be returning. While it’s too early to declare a full reversal, the signs are promising. That said, I’m still watching key concerns, like weak participation and the need for a broader rebound. Despite these challenges, this market still offers plenty of opportunity. Let me explain more.

The Equal-Weight S&amp;P 500 Index (RSP) just posted a bullish engulfing candle the day after Fed Day, joined by similar patterns in the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq. This means the bears started strong, but the bulls completely took over by day’s end—a powerful signal of momentum. Even better, the follow-up price action confirmed the pattern, and this wasn’t just driven by the Magnificent 7—it was broad-based. Plus, key support levels held firm in the S&amp;P 500. These signs all point to healthy price action. I break it down further in today's Insight of the Day.
