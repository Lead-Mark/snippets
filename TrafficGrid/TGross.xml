Today's chart shows the Volatility Index (VIX). You can see it spiking during the April pullback and then coming back down in May as the market recovered. It spiked again in the second half of last week as the market retreated slightly. We’ll have to see if the VIX goes back down this week. If it doesn’t, we could be in for another shallow pullback. If you’ve followed this newsletter for any length of time, you’ll recognize it for what it is. I explain more in the Insight of the Day.

Here's the percentage of stocks trading above their 200-day moving average over the past year. Here’s the percentage of stocks trading above their 50-day moving averages. Since the beginning of this month, the percentages of stocks trading above their 200 and 50-day moving averages have spiked. This means participation in this bull market has been sharply increasing – we’re no longer in a narrow bull market. This expanding base will provide the foundation for the bull market to keep chugging on. But what’s causing this expansion in breadth? And how can we take advantage of it? I’ll explain more in the Insight of the Day.

The five major Wall Street banks made nearly $15 billion in stock trading profits in the second quarter – 18% higher than last year. As a former VP at one of these banks, this doesn't surprise me. They have the capital to move markets with their trades, leveraging not just their own money but also influencing their top clients' trades. It's not an even playing field, but knowing how the game is played can work to our advantage.

As of last week, markets were pricing in two 0.25% rate cuts by the Fed by year-end. Now, they’re expecting nearly three. Since the Fed moves rates by at least 0.25%, this means the market anticipates either a 0.50% or 0.75% cut. This expectation of higher rate cuts is a good sign. But as I explain in the Insight of the Day, you don’t want to wait for the rate cuts to happen.
