There’s currently $6.3 trillion sitting on the sidelines in money market funds – the highest we’ve seen in months. With risk appetite fading, it’s no surprise this pile of cash is growing.

This surge could catch many off guard, but not those paying attention. Don’t be one of the surprised – be prepared.

By adding a volume profile to the S&amp;P 500 chart, we get a clearer view of key trading levels. The 545 and 530 zones have seen high-volume activity, acting as magnets for price movement. But it’s the low-volume 538 level I’m watching closely. Historically, levels like this get rejected or blown through quickly. If we don’t see a bounce next week, the selloff could continue. Even so, there are still opportunities in individual stocks if your trading edge holds up in a negative momentum environment.

Today’s chart shows XLF, the ETF tracking a basket of financial stocks. It’s been on a tear recently, surging well past its mid-July highs as the market anticipates the Fed’s upcoming rate cuts. This is just one example of the pockets of strength I’ve been talking about—and there are plenty more if you know where to look. The sharp rise in financials also highlights a crucial trading lesson, which I explain in today’s Insight of the Day.

Today's chart reveals an intriguing twist from the AAII weekly survey. Despite the sharp selloff on Tuesday, bullish sentiment remains above average, while bearish sentiment has actually decreased. Most would expect the opposite, but the data tells a different story. As I delve into in the Insight of the Day, this divergence is a powerful reminder not to take market signals at face value.
