This chart reveals how the Volatility Index (VIX) typically behaves after a major spike—like the one we saw on Wednesday. Historically, the VIX tends to settle down in the days following such jumps, and a calmer VIX often signals better days for the markets. We saw this play out after the August 5 selloff, and it could happen again. No guarantees, of course—but the odds seem to favor us. I break it all down in today’s insight.

This is how the market reacted as soon as Powell started talking. His cautious tone about future rate adjustments—after already cutting rates by 1%—wasn’t what investors wanted to hear. The result? The worst selloff since August 5 and a major spike in the VIX. But let’s not forget what happened after that August panic: a swift V-shaped recovery. Is a repeat guaranteed? Of course not—but the odds still look favorable. The key takeaway from this volatility? I break it all down today.

This chart breaks down how the S&amp;P 500 typically reacts—both daily and in the final hour of trading—under different Fed chairs. Powell? So far, he holds the worst average, especially in that critical final hour on Fed day. If we see a dip later, it wouldn’t be surprising. But here’s the bigger picture: Powell’s record is skewed by one of the fastest rate-hiking cycles ever, and despite that, he’s overseen one of history’s strongest bull markets. What does this mean for us? I break it down today.

The Equal-Weight S&amp;P 500 (RSP) has been quietly pulling back this month, slipping below its 21-day moving average and nearing its 50-day. Most traders are missing this “hidden” pullback because they’re focused on market-cap weighted indexes, which are being propped up by the Magnificent 7 stocks. This divergence also explains why the Nasdaq closed higher last week. The real question is—how can we take advantage of this pullback? I break it all down in today’s Insight of the Day.

This chart highlights the number of 5% or greater pullbacks during past bull markets. The average bull market sees eight such pullbacks, but so far in this one, we’ve only experienced five. And that’s just counting the “deep” ones. The Equal-Weight S&amp;P 500 pullback I mentioned yesterday? It’s barely over 3%. The takeaway? We’re not seeing “too many” pullbacks at all. The data is clear—stay in the game. I explain more in today’s Insight of the Day.
