The Equal-Weight S&amp;P 500 (RSP) has been quietly pulling back this month, slipping below its 21-day moving average and nearing its 50-day. Most traders are missing this “hidden” pullback because they’re focused on market-cap weighted indexes, which are being propped up by the Magnificent 7 stocks. This divergence also explains why the Nasdaq closed higher last week. The real question is—how can we take advantage of this pullback? I break it all down in today’s Insight of the Day.

This chart tracks the net difference between 52-week highs and lows on the NYSE. While we’re still seeing more highs than lows, that gap is shrinking. Let me be clear—this isn’t a signal of an impending bear market. But it does indicate pullbacks in smaller, less-popular stocks. For traders like us, that’s an opportunity to scoop up the most explosive names at much better prices. I dive into the details in today’s Insight of the Day.

The chart above shows the RSP, the Equal-Weight S&amp;P 500 Index. While the Magnificent Seven stocks are pushing the broader S&amp;P 500 higher, the equal-weight version tells a different story. It just dipped below its 21-day moving average, signaling a potential pullback. This could be a prime buying opportunity that most investors haven’t noticed yet. I break down what this means for you in today’s Insight of the Day.

Options trading in the U.S. is skyrocketing, with average daily volume hitting record highs, as shown in this chart dating back to 2018. While this surge may tempt individual traders to chase riskier bets, it often comes at the expense of sound risk management.
