Junk bonds can be a key signal for market sentiment. When investors are willing to take on more risk in these high-yield bonds, it usually means confidence is rising.

The Nasdaq may still be 4% off its previous highs, but the Equal-Weighted S&amp;P 500 – which downplays the impact of mega-cap tech – already broke through its highs this week.
